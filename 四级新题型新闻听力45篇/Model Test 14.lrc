[00:48.01]As part of a three-year project,
[00:50.79]a group of American high school students 
[00:53.48]and their teachers are spending three weeks 
[00:56.35]each summer in Senegal,
[00:59.13]helping to modernize Keur Sadaro,
[01:02.16]a rural village three hours from Senegal¡¯s capital,Dakar. 
[01:07.38]The 21 teens from two private high schools
[01:10.50] in San Francisco,California. 
[01:13.19]This spring before leaving for Africa,
[01:16.23]they attended Saturday classes

[01:24.58]Each year, 
[01:25.39]the students bring athletic equipment,medicine, tools
[01:29.24] and computers to share with the villagers. 
[01:32.68]In the first year of the project,last summer,
[01:36.19]a dilapidated French colonial house,
[01:39.17]inhabited by ducks and chickens,
[01:41.76]was fixed up as a clinic .
[01:44.04]During this summer¡¯s three-week stay,
[01:47.54]the students worked on the village schoolhouse. 
[01:51.07]They helped put a roof on it,
[01:53.43]install solar panels and lights,lay a floor,
[01:56.93]and build desks. 
[01:59.07]They taught village teachers
[02:00.89] how to operate donated computers.
[02:05.74]1.What¡¯s the topic of this news report?
[02:25.37]2.What¡¯s the students¡¯ work this summer? 
[02:44.98]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:50.64]A passenger jet headed for New York City 
[02:53.47]was forced to land at Halifax,
[02:56.07]Canada this morning.
[02:57.72]The plane¡¯s transponder was broadcasting
[03:00.24] a signal indicating it had been hijacked.
[03:03.91]The Virgin Atlantic flight from London¡¯s Heathrow Airport
[03:06.65] was midway across the Atlantic
[03:09.72] when air traffic control officials 
[03:11.68]in the US started receiving its signal: 
[03:15.28]a signal which carried a special code indicating
[03:18.02] there was a hijacking in progress.
[03:21.66]Canadian fighter jets operating under NORAD,
[03:25.06]the joint Canada-US command,
[03:27.27]were scrambled to intercept the jet.According to NORAD,
[03:31.86]the pilots of the passenger jet repeatedly radioed in
[03:34.34] to tell controllers they were not being hijacked. 
[03:38.59]But US officials erred on the side of caution. 
[03:42.37]After the plane landed,
[03:43.94]armed police boarded it 
[03:45.49]to ensure there were no hijackers.
[03:48.50]It was determined that
[03:49.51]the plane¡¯s transponder had mal-functioned,
[03:52.15]and was mistakenly transmitting code ¡°7500¡± for hijacking.
[03:59.90]3.Why was the passenger jet forced to land at Halifax,Canada?

[05:03.69]Forecasters warned that Wednesday
[05:05.96] could be the worst day
[05:08.12] since the crisis began more than a week ago.

[05:14.84] their most challenging day yet; 
[05:17.60]they have been carrying out 
[05:19.52]controlled burning of key areas. 
[05:22.54]The ideal was to deprive fires of fuel
[05:25.78] and prevent them travelling. 
[05:28.77]On Monday, they joined up two large fires
[05:32.24] to make one that is easier to manage. 
[05:35.33]Around 60 fires are burning in New South Wales,
[05:39.67]but about 17 of them are still uncontrolled. 
[05:44.53]Almost 120 000 hectares have been ruined
