[00:45.55]The violence this week in Kenya 
[00:47.36]has thrown the usually peaceful country into crisis. 
[00:52.53]Its economic and democratic progress may be in danger. 
[00:57.03]The crisis began Sunday 
[01:00.05]after election officials declared President Mwai Kibaki 
[01:04.80]the winner of a second term. 
[01:06.92]On Friday Kenya¡¯s main opposition party,
[01:10.89]the Orange Democratic Movement,
[01:13.27]called for a new election. 
[01:15.48]Its candidate in the December twenty-seventh election,
[01:19.64]Raila Odinga,
[01:21.56]held the lead in early vote totals. 
[01:24.56]He says the narrow victory for Mister Kibaki 
[01:27.89]was the result of cheating. 
[01:30.04]More than three hundred people have been killed in Nairobi,
[01:34.56]the Rift Valley and Mombasa.

[02:34.32]Canada¡¯s government says it will proceed with plans 
[02:37.27]to send military advisers to Sudan¡¯s Darfur region. 
[02:41.14]That comes despite Sudan saying 
[02:44.32]it does not want Canadian troops to enter the country.
[02:47.36]Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin¡¯s aid package for Darfur 
[02:53.14]includes about 140 million dollars 
[02:56.19]and up to 100 military experts 
[02:59.09]to help the African Union peacekeeping force. 
[03:02.00](But Sudan hasn¡¯t been happy with the move. 
[03:06.18]The government in Khartoum says 
[03:08.74]it doesn¡¯t want non-African troops in Darfur 
[03:11.96]and it complained that it had not been properly consulted by Ottawa. 
[03:15.90]But Martin¡¯s office appears undeterred,
[03:19.98]saying Canada needs only the approval of the African Union 
[03:23.96]for the deployment of troops 
[03:25.79]and it¡¯s up to the AU to get Sudan¡¯s approval. 
[03:30.00]A spokesman for the Prime Minister says that means 
[03:33.87]there was no change of plans. 
[03:36.14]But some critics say Canada should do more. 
[03:39.83]One MP says the plan should include 400 million dollars 
[03:44.19]and 500 soldiers. 
[03:46.31]The 2-year civil war in Darfur has killed 
[03:49.98]more than 300 thousand people and displaced more than 2 million.

[04:54.31]to craft a replacement for the Kyoto Protocol,

[05:01.92]at the end of this month. 
[05:04.14]The negotiations are deadlocked over demands

[05:15.85]Developing countries are demanding 
[05:18.26]that industrialized nations fulfill their pledges

[05:29.08]and other greenhouse gases,
[05:31.11]and to put new,
[05:32.49]larger emission curbs on the table.
