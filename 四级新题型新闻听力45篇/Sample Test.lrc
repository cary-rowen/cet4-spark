[00:03.55]Section A
[00:05.47]Directions: In this section,
[00:08.78]you will hear three news reports. 
[00:12.20]At the end of each news report,
[00:14.68]you will hear two or three questions. 
[00:17.91]Both the news report and the questions 
[00:20.68]will be spoken only once. 
[00:23.60]After you hear a question,
[00:25.96]you must choose the best answer from the four choices 
[00:29.76]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[00:33.05]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[00:37.17]with a single line through the centre.
[00:40.55]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:46.64]Kenyan police say one person was killed and 26 injured 
[00:51.30]in an explosion at a bus station in central Nairobi. 
[00:56.05]The blast hit a bus about to set off for the Ugandan capital Kampala. 
[01:02.50]Last July, the Somali group al-Shabab said 
[01:06.09]it was behind the blasts in the Ugandan capital 
[01:09.18]which killed more than 70 people. 
[01:12.26]Will Ross reports from the Kenyan capital.
[01:16.23]The explosion happened beside a bus 
[01:18.89]which was about to set off for an overnight journey 
[01:22.60]from Nairobi to the Ugandan capital Kampala. 
[01:26.62]Some eyewitnesses report that a bag 
[01:29.23]was about to be loaded on board,
[01:32.08]but it exploded during a security check. 
[01:35.80]Windows of the red bus were left smashed,
[01:39.26]and blood could be seen on the ground beside the vehicle. 
[01:43.43]Just hours earlier,
[01:45.21]Uganda¡¯s police chief had warned of possible 
[01:48.74]Christmas-time attacks by Somali rebels.
[01:53.69]1. What is the news report mainly about?
[02:14.21]2. When did the incident occur?
[02:33.36]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:39.37]Woolworths is one of the best known names 
[02:42.03]on the British High Street. 
[02:44.33]It¡¯s been in business nearly a century.
[02:47.43]Many of its 800 stores are likely to close 
[02:51.35]following the company¡¯s decision 
[02:53.16]to call in administrators after an attempt
[02:56.51] to sell the business for a token ¡ê1 failed.
[03:01.27]The company has huge debts. 
[03:04.27]The immediate cause for the collapse 
[03:06.24]has been Britain¡¯s slide toward recession,
[03:09.45]which has cut into consumer spending. 
[03:12.18]However, the business had been in trouble for years.
[03:16.91]Known for low-priced general goods,
[03:19.78]Woolworths has struggled in the face of competition 
[03:22.91]from supermarkets expanding beyond groceries 
[03:26.20]and a new generation of internet retailers. 
[03:30.03]Many of the store group¡¯s 25 000 employees 
[03:33.92]are likely to lose their jobs. 
[03:36.76]Some profitable areas such as 
[03:39.21]the DVD publishing business will survive.
[03:43.93]3. What do we learn about Woolworths from the news report?
[04:05.32]4. What did Woolworths attempt to do recently?
[04:26.13]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:31.92]Cairo is known for its overcrowded roads,
[04:36.25]irregular driving practices and shaky old vehicles,
[04:40.85]but also for its air pollution. 
[04:43.71]In recent months, though, environmental studies 
[04:47.21]indicate there have been signs of improvement. 
[04:51.16]That¡¯s due in part to the removal of many 
[04:54.11]of the capital¡¯s old-fashioned black and white taxis. 
[04:58.49]Most of these dated back to the 1960s and 70s 
[05:03.54]and were in a poor state of repair.
[05:06.54]After new legislation demanded 
[05:09.40]their removal from the roads,
[05:11.94]a low interest loan scheme was set up 
[05:15.11]with three Egyptian banks so drivers could buy new cars. 
[05:20.31]The government pays about $900 for old ones 
[05:24.76]to be discarded and advertising on the new vehicles 
[05:29.02]helps cover repayments.
[05:31.73]The idea has proved popular with customers
[05:35.72]¡ªthey can now travel in air-conditioned comfort 
[05:39.43]and because the new cabs are metered,
[05:42.62]they don¡¯t have to argue over fares. 
[05:45.71]Banks and car manufacturers are glad 
[05:49.03]for the extra business in tough economic times. 
[05:52.80]As for the taxi drivers,
[05:55.13]most are delighted to be behind the wheel of new cars,
[05:59.96]although there have been a few complaints 
[06:03.57]about switching from black and white to a plain white colour.
[06:08.87]5. What change took place in Cairo recently?
[06:29.66]6. What helped bring about the change?
[06:49.75]7. Why do customers no longer argue with new cab drivers?
