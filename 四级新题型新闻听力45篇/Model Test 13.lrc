[00:18.35]Both the news report and the questions 
[00:20.84]will be spoken only once. 
[00:24.30]After you hear a question,
[00:26.40]you must choose the best answer
[00:28.65] from the four choices 
[00:30.01]marked A),B), C) and D). 
[00:33.46]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:37.43] with a single line through the centre.
[00:40.16]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:45.90]It¡¯s the first Tuesday following the first Monday in November. 
[00:50.56]In the US that means it¡¯s Election Day. 
[00:54.51]Governors¡¯ races, the New York mayoral election,
[00:58.49]different state referenda
[01:00.78]¡ªthat¡¯s when people vote on issues
[01:03.09] rather than individual offices. 
[01:05.88]Some of today¡¯s elections are getting national attention.
[01:10.69]We¡¯re going to start in New Jersey
[01:13.15] where voters are casting their ballot for governor. 
[01:17.16]According to the most recent polls,current governor,
[01:19.65]Chris Christie is expected to be reelected. 
[01:24.54]There is a governor¡¯s race in Virginia,too. 
[01:27.85]The state doesn¡¯t allow governors
[01:29.57] to serve consecutive terms,
[01:32.20]so the new governor will 
[01:33.94]either be Republican Ken Cuccinelli on the left
[01:38.07] or Democrat Terry McAuliffe. 
[01:41.06]There is an interesting referendum
[01:42.92] on the ballot in Colorado
[01:45.51]¡ª11 counties are voting on whether to withdraw,
[01:48.93]break off from the state.

[02:41.73]Consumer spending accounts for more than
[02:44.07] two thirds of US economic activity,

[02:49.08] watched economic indicators. 
[02:52.03]The Commerce Department reports that 
[02:53.94]Americans boosted spending 0.4 percent in June
[02:58.88]¡ªslightly more than what economists had expected. 
[03:02.44]It was the second consecutive
[03:04.42] monthly rise in consumer spending,
[03:06.90]and it was accompanied by a lower savings rate.
[03:10.65]Americans spent more despite lower incomes. 
[03:14.50]Personal income fell 1.3 percent
[03:17.79]¡ªthe largest monthly drop in four years. 
[03:20.97]The decline reversed a 1.3 percent increase
[03:24.29] in personal incomes in May
[03:26.40] that economists attributed to special payments 
[03:29.49]the government made to try to revive the economy.

[04:40.82]to support programs he says will help boost hiring.

[04:50.61]to 9.7 percent,
[04:53.08]its lowest level in five months. 
[04:56.07]However, the Labor Department says 
[04:58.25]20 000 more jobs were lost last month. 
[05:02.66]President Obama says
[05:04.18] that is a small step in the right direction. 
[05:07.91]¡°These numbers, while positive,
[05:10.54]are cause for hope but not celebration,
[05:14.28]because far too many of our neighbors
[05:17.16] and friends and family 
[05:18.30]are still out of work,¡± he said.
