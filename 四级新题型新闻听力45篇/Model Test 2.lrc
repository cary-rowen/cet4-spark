[00:55.71]Although the number of new cases has slowed,
[01:00.87]hundreds more infections were reported on Tuesday. 
[01:03.48]The UN and aid agencies are boosting prevention efforts 
[01:09.12]in and around the capital,Port-au-Prince, 
[01:12.32]with a public information campaign on hygiene.
[01:16.33]Experts say that after a long absence from Haiti,
[01:20.09]ingestion disease could now ¡°settle¡± 
[01:22.89]and become a local disease. 
[01:25.53]The UN said 25 more people had died of the disease on Tuesday,
[01:30.85]bringing the total to 284. 
[01:34.22]A total of 3 612 cases have been reported. 
[01:40.25]Health experts say they expect 
[01:43.13]the outbreak will soon lessen 
[01:45.91]but the disease will eventually join malaria and tuberculosis,
[01:50.29]becoming a local disease in Haiti.
[01:52.90]1.What did the UN and aid agencies do for the disease?
[02:16.83]2.What can be inferred from the health experts?
[02:36.86]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:41.33]International Baccalaureate schools began decades ago 
[02:46.55]as a way to teach the globe-trotting children 
[02:49.21]of the international diplomatic corps. 
[02:52.20]Now, IB schools welcome all kinds of children. 
[02:56.81]The program combines what are considered to be 
[03:00.57]the best teaching techniques,
[03:02.88]a rigorous curriculum stressing writing and analysis,
[03:07.19]and an international perspective. 
[03:09.42]The goal is to develop involved,

[03:19.13]The school district here has set up an International Baccalaureate program 
[03:24.17]at Lone Pine Elementary. 
[03:27.38]At IB elementary schools,
[03:30.00]subjects like math and reading are not taught separately. 
[03:34.12]Subject areas are integrated,
[03:37.76]so lessons in ¡°Mother Earth¡± class,for example,
[03:41.15]cover vocabulary,literature, history, and ecology. 
[03:45.81]The program also breaks down the proverbial classroom wall. 
[03:51.14]Teachers are required to compare notes and plan classes together. 
[03:55.75]That¡¯s the ¡°best practice¡± that IB schools have adopted 
[04:00.57]because it develops teachers¡¯ skills.
