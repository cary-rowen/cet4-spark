[01:04.09]The General Secretary of
[01:05.80] the National Union of Mineworkers,
[01:08.21]Frans Baleni told the BBC that 
[01:11.04]if the gold companies offered a 10% wage increase,
[01:15.34]this would be accepted 
[01:17.20]and the strike would be called off. 
[01:20.54]Despite this development,

[01:36.10] the devastating impact industrial action
