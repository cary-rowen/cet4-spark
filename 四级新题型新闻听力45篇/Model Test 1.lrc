[00:03.32]Model Test One
[00:04.52]Section A
[00:05.71]Directions: In this section,
[00:08.73]you will hear three news reports.
[00:11.90]At the end of each news report,
[00:14.43]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:17.65]Both the news report and the questions will be spoken only once.
[00:23.18]After you hear a question,
[00:25.97]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[00:29.77]marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:32.79]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:37.02]with a single line through the centre.
[00:39.67]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:44.61]The shooting occurred Thursday in a lecture hall
[00:49.52]at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb,
[00:52.81]Illinois, north of Chicago.
[00:54.98]The gunman entered the hall dressed in black
[00:58.18]and carrying a shotgun and three handguns
[01:01.52]and began firing as students sought cover under desks.
[01:06.00]One student who escaped unharmed told reporters
[01:10.93]his life had changed as a result of what he experienced.
[01:15.15]Police say the gunman was Steven Kazmierczak,
[01:19.49]27, a former graduate student in Sociology at the school.
[01:25.79]Police say he purchased the shotgun
[01:29.43]and two of the handguns on Saturday,
[01:32.01]indicating he may have planned the attack in advance,
[01:36.30]but authorities have not determined a motive for the shooting.
[01:41.54]Kazmierczak had no criminal record and no history of mental illness.
[01:48.13]Under Illinois state law he would not
[01:52.10]have been able to purchase a weapon legally
[01:54.30]if there had been a record of arrests or mental problems.
[01:58.69]But police say he stopped taking an unspecified medication recently
[02:04.69]and his behavior became erratic.
[02:09.09]1. What is this news item mainly about?
[02:29.31]2. What is the reason of the shooting?
[02:48.63]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:54.41]In recent months a string of countries,
[02:56.90]from Japan to Switzerland,
[02:58.55]Colombia to Israel,
[03:00.63]have tried to drive down the value of their currencies.
[03:04.38]Some experts call it ¡°competitive devaluation.¡± Others,
[03:09.99]though, argue that it is nothing short of a currency war¡ª
[03:14.62]and far from boosting global recovery,
[03:17.21]it threatens to undermine it.
[03:19.44]So concerned are policymakers that the issue looks set
[03:24.26]to dominate talks on Friday
[03:26.23]at a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers.
[03:30.02]Dominique Strauss-Kahn,
[03:32.70]managing director of the International Monetary Fund,
[03:36.03]which hosts the meeting in Washington,
[03:38.40]set out the concerns in the Financial Times on Tuesday.
[03:42.86]¡°There is clearly the idea beginning to circulate
[03:46.98]that currencies can be used as a policy weapon.
[03:50.40]Translated into action,
[03:52.69]such an idea would represent a very serious risk
[03:56.92]to the global recovery,¡± he said.
[03:59.11]3.What has happened to Israel¡¯s currency?
[04:20.62]4.What can we learn from Dominique Strauss-Kahn?
[04:40.67]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:47.18]The latest round of United Nations climate change talks
[04:50.63]begins Monday in the coastal resort city of Cancun,Mexico.
[04:55.85]Representatives from 194 countries are scheduled to attend.
[05:01.07]Negotiators will try to close the political gap
[05:05.97]between commitments to reduce carbon emissions
[05:09.15]made by developed and developing nations.
[05:12.33]Last year¡¯s talks in Copenhagen,
[05:15.41]Denmark, carried high hopes for a binding global agreement
[05:20.19]to curb carbon emissions,
[05:22.61]but in the end delivered a disappointing and loose set of voluntary actions
[05:29.00]named the ¡°Copenhagen Accord.¡±
[05:32.77]Eighty countries responsible for 80 percent
[05:35.62]of the world¡¯s carbon emissions signed the accord,
[05:39.15]agreeing¡ªamong other things¡ª
[05:42.08]that the global temperature rise should be limited
[05:45.68]to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
[05:51.61]5.What is the latest round of UN climate change talks focused on?
[06:15.14]6. How was the result of last year¡¯s talks in Copenhagen?
[06:36.15]7.How many countries signed the ¡°Copenhagen Accord¡±?
