[00:16.71]Model Test Three
[00:18.64]Section A
[00:20.13]Directions: In this section, 
[00:22.28]you will hear 8 short conversations 
[00:25.02]and 2 long conversations. 
[00:27.84]At the end of each conversation,
[00:30.52]one or more questions will be asked 
[00:33.12]about what was said. 
[00:34.89]Both the conversation and the questions 
[00:38.23]will be spoken only once. 
[00:40.83]After each question there will be a pause. 
[00:44.40]During the pause, 
[00:45.93]you must read the four choices 
[00:48.25]marked A), B), C) and D), 
[00:51.60]and decide which is the best answer. 
[00:54.83]Then mark the corresponding letter 
[00:57.70]on Answer Sheet 1 
[00:59.41]with a single line through the centre. 
[01:02.28]Now let¡¯s begin with the eight short conversations.
[01:07.57]1. W: John, look at this coat. 
[01:10.72]You bought it for me 
[01:11.97]when you were chasing me. 
[01:13.62]M: Yeah, it was a long time ago 
[01:15.97]and the coat is worn out. 
[01:17.94]I think I should buy you a new one. 
[01:20.58]Q: What is the relationship 
[01:22.11]between the two speakers? 
[01:39.45]2. W: I¡¯m afraid that
[01:41.57] we¡¯re not satisfied with these plans 
[01:43.88]for the drawing room.
[01:45.56]M: Would you like me 
[01:46.36]to prepare another set of blueprints?
[01:48.97]Q: What¡¯s the man¡¯s job?
[02:05.71]3. M: If you ask me, 
[02:08.65]I suggest you go there by plane. 
[02:11.48]It¡¯s quick and convenient. 
[02:13.37]W: Yeah, it¡¯s true, 
[02:14.73]but I¡¯m terribly airsick.
[02:16.93]Q: What can we infer about the woman? 
[02:34.52]4. W: I¡¯ve been thinking of my sister 
[02:37.83]the whole day.
[02:39.10]M: Why not give her an unexpected arrival?
[02:42.80]Q: What does the man suggest the woman do?
[03:00.82]5. M: I didn¡¯t see Mary for several days. 
[03:04.75]What did she do?
[03:06.00]W: She was busy preparing for her thesis debate.
[03:09.12]Q: What did Mary do in the past few days? 
[03:27.19]6. W:  I really like the Italian food 
[03:31.02]we took yesterday. 
[03:32.37]What do you think?
[03:33.95]M: Aha, it¡¯s good,
[03:35.58]but it¡¯s not my taste.
[03:37.81]Q: What does the man imply?
[03:54.73]7. M: Why do so many boys wear long hair 
[03:59.55]in your class?
[04:00.57]W: Oh, you see. Bill does so 
[04:02.64]and the other boys just follow suit.
[04:05.42]Q: What can we infer from the conversation? 
[04:23.43]8. W: What do you think 
[04:26.04]of my new idea for that contract, Tom?
[04:29.33]M: I can¡¯t come up with a better one, Jenny.
[04:32.53]Q: What does the man mean?
[04:49.61]Now you¡¯ll hear the two long conversations.
[04:54.11]Conversation One
[04:56.16]W: Mike, why are so many Americans overweight?
[04:59.98]M: Well, that¡¯s a good question, Lily. 
[05:02.66]You¡¯d think that 
[05:04.09]with the current fitness craze in the US, 
[05:07.20]there wouldn¡¯t be so many overweight Americans.
[05:10.69]W: Yes. How many people are overweight?
[05:13.89]M: About 40% of Americans are overweight. 
[05:17.44]What¡¯s interesting is that one study says 
[05:20.82]that lower-income groups 
[05:22.82]have a higher percentage of being overweight 
[05:26.25]than higher-income groups.
[05:28.28]W: Are there any other factors like that in the study?
[05:31.74]M: Yes. The study also says 
[05:34.63]that the hotter the climate is, 
[05:36.80]the lower the percentage of fat people is.
[05:39.99]W: That makes sense. 
[05:41.83]When it¡¯s hot, 
[05:42.86]you usually don¡¯t feel like eating a lot.
[05:45.57]M: Is that why Japanese people 
[05:47.81]are typically skinnier than Americans?
[05:50.83]W: Well, our food has less fat and oil 
[05:53.69]than American food does. 
[05:55.43]And Americans eat a lot more meat than we do. 
[05:58.84]M: You¡¯re right. 
[05:59.73]And we also eat more sugar and junk food. 
[06:02.94]But there¡¯s another reason 
[06:04.37]why so many Americans are fat.
[06:07.15]W: What¡¯s that?
[06:09.04]M: Nobody works out any more¡ª
[06:11.40]not even kids. 
[06:12.79]The average American home has the TV on 
[06:15.86]for six hours a day!
[06:17.75]W: Wow! No wonder you Americans are so fat. 
[06:21.43]You don¡¯t get enough exercise. 
[06:23.93]Say, Mike, aren¡¯t you getting a little bigger in the waist?
[06:28.10]M: Yeah, I guess so.
[06:30.08]W: To lose weight, 
[06:31.11]you really need to 
[06:32.00]watch what you eat and get some exercise.
[06:34.93]M: Hey, I started a diet and lost ten pounds.
[06:38.73]W: So what happened afterwards? 
[06:41.13]M: I quit and gained it all back plus five pounds.
[06:47.27]Questions 9 to 12 are based on the conversation 
[06:51.26]you have just heard.
[06:54.43]9. What does the study say about lower-income groups?
[07:15.41]10. What is the reason the man gives for Americans¡¯ fatness?
[07:36.35]11. What does the woman suggest the man do 
[07:40.57]to lose weight?
[07:56.94]12. What happened to the man finally?
[08:15.71]Conversation Two
[08:17.86]M: Good morning, Amanda£¡
[08:19.16]W: Hi, Mike! Nice day, isn¡¯t it?
[08:21.88]M: Yeah, so why are you up so early? 
[08:24.98]Have you decided to 
[08:26.19]take up jogging in the park like me?
[08:28.55]W: No, Mike. You know I really can¡¯t stand jogging. 
[08:32.58]It¡¯s so boring. 
[08:34.02]I¡¯ve joined a yoga class at our local fitness centre.
[08:38.08]I hear it¡¯s a great way to stay fit. 
[08:41.40]Want to join me?
[08:42.79]M: No way! Yoga is for girls. 
[08:46.74]I¡¯d rather do some weights at the gym at weekends 
[08:50.36]than put my body into painful postures.
[08:53.38]W: Come on, there¡¯s more fun in yoga than that! 
[08:56.78]It¡¯s perfect for 
[08:57.97]both physical and spiritual well-being. 
[09:00.79]It also helps your body become more flexible.
[09:04.20]M: No, thanks. I think all of this is 
[09:07.22]just a money-making game. 
[09:09.44]I¡¯m telling you Amanda, 
[09:11.27]don¡¯t buy into it! 
[09:13.19]If you want to keep fit, 
[09:14.95]you should take some physical exercises. 
[09:18.00]W: Mike, we just learn three new postures every day 
[09:21.67]and do some meditation. 
[09:23.71]My yoga mentor is going to 
[09:25.90]teach us about breathing today. 
[09:28.05]Do you know that 
[09:29.27]we don¡¯t even breathe properly any more?
[09:32.39]M: Count me out! 
[09:34.06]I don¡¯t need anyone 
[09:35.52]to tell me how to breathe! 
[09:37.71]Just because celebrities are doing yoga, 
[09:40.84]everyone¡¯s jumping on the bandwagon.
[09:43.66]W: That¡¯s not true! 
[09:44.92]You¡¯re always reluctant to try something new. 
[09:47.91]Give it a chance, 
[09:49.21]you might enjoy it.
[09:50.65]M: OK, but only if you promise 
[09:53.60]I¡¯ll end up with a body
[09:55.37] like a tough strong man!
[09:59.80]Questions 13 to 15 are based on the conversation 
[10:03.77]you have just heard.
[10:06.76]13. What kind of exercise does the man do in the morning?
[10:27.67]14. Which is a function of yoga?
[10:46.34]15. Why is yoga popular nowadays according to the man?
[11:07.57]Section B
[11:08.78]Directions: In this section, 
[11:11.11]you will hear 3 short passages. 
[11:13.96]At the end of each passage,
[11:16.02]you will hear some questions. 
[11:18.18]Both the passage and the questions 
[11:20.79]will be spoken only once.
[11:23.37]After you hear a question, 
[11:25.49]you must choose the best answer 
[11:27.84]from the four choices 
[11:29.43]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[11:32.47]Then mark the corresponding letter 
[11:35.11]on Answer Sheet 1 
[11:36.89]with a single line through the centre.
[11:41.12]Passage One
[11:43.34]Costa Rica is at the southern point of Central America, 
[11:47.87]borders to the north by Nicaragua 
[11:50.95]and Panama to the south. 
[11:52.87]It¡¯s a little smaller 
[11:54.23]than the state of West Virginia 
[11:56.56]and largely mountainous with thin strips of low lands 
[12:01.10]by the Pacific and Caribbean. 
[12:03.38]Traditionally focused on exporting bananas and coffee, 
[12:07.46]Costa Rica¡¯s new top industry is tourism. 
[12:11.69]Many tourists arrive in the capital San Jos¨¦ 
[12:15.65]and head straight for the Pacific coast beaches. 
[12:18.98]But if you are looking for something 
[12:21.67]a little out of the ordinary, 
[12:24.11]the country has several prime spots for volcano watching 
[12:28.76]but the most popular is Arenal, 
[12:31.39]near the town of La Fortuna. 
[12:34.01]The volcano creates many hot springs. 
[12:37.26]Costa Rica is rich in wild life 
[12:40.26]and ranks as one of the most bio-diverse countries. 
[12:44.59]Its national parks are home to everything 
[12:48.39]from howler monkeys to white-faced capuchins. 
[12:52.40]It¡¯s a bird watchers¡¯ paradise 
[12:54.72]with over 800 species. 
[12:57.05]On the ground, 
[12:58.61]tapirs sniff for food 
[13:00.74]using their short trunks 
[13:02.42]to grab leaves and fruit. 
[13:04.30]Along the coast, turtle watching is popular, 
[13:07.83]especially in April and May. 
[13:10.77]Leatherbacks and green turtles lurch upon to the beach 
[13:15.03]to lay their eggs. 
[13:16.41]They only rest for a little while 
[13:19.09]before making the return trip 
[13:21.12]back out to sea. 
[13:22.71]So it¡¯s natural 
[13:24.21]that when you¡¯re planning a trip, 
[13:26.05]the right time to go 
[13:27.81]depends on what you want to do. 
[13:30.44]The dry season for most of the country
[13:33.15]runs from December to April. 
[13:35.90]The following months are wet seasons. 
[13:38.67]The different parts of the year 
[13:40.47]are best for surfing, fishing and animal watching, 
[13:44.72]so there is always something happening. 
[13:49.20]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage 
[13:53.29]you have just heard.
[13:56.56]16. What¡¯s the top industry of Costa Rica nowadays?
[14:17.76]17. When can tourists see turtles along the coast?
[14:38.39]18. When is the wet season for most of Costa Rica?
[14:58.19]Passage Two
[15:00.53]A total solar eclipse occurred this year. 
[15:03.73]A solar eclipse occurs 
[15:05.45]when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, 
[15:09.56]thereby totally or partially obscuring the Earth¡¯s view of the Sun. 
[15:15.26]A total solar eclipse occurs 
[15:17.94]when the Moon¡¯s apparent diameter is larger than the Sun, 
[15:22.28]blocking all direct sunlight and turning day into darkness. 
[15:27.60]And it occurs in a narrow path 
[15:30.07]across the surface of the Earth, 
[15:32.61]while a partial solar eclipse will be visible 
[15:36.17]over a region thousands of miles wide. 
[15:39.35]It had a magnitude of 1.0394 that was visible from a narrow corridor 
[15:46.90]through northern Canada, Greenland, central Russia, 
[15:50.68]eastern Kazakhstan, western Mongolia. 
[15:54.21]Occurring north of the Arctic Circle, 
[15:56.99]it belonged to the so-called midnight sun eclipses. 
[16:01.15]The largest city on the path of the eclipse 
[16:04.21]was Novosibirsk in Russia. 
[16:06.82]The total eclipse lasted for two minutes, 
[16:09.68]and covered 0.4% of the Earth¡¯s surface 
[16:13.73]in a 10 200 km long path. 
[16:17.59]It is the 47th eclipse of the 126th Saros cycle, 
[16:23.47]which began with a partial eclipse on March 10, 1179 
[16:29.39]and will conclude with a partial eclipse on May 3, 2459. 
[16:36.24]It was described by observers 
[16:38.51]as ¡°special for its colors around the horizon. 
[16:42.10]There were wonderful oranges and reds all around, 
[16:46.05]the clouds lit up, 
[16:47.59]some dark in silhouette, some golden, 
[16:50.71]glowing yellowy-orange in the distance. 
[16:53.35]You could see the shadow 
[16:54.91]approaching against the clouds 
[16:56.97]and then rushing away as it left.¡±
[17:00.69]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage 
[17:05.75]you have just heard.
[17:08.83]19. When does solar eclipse happen£¿
[17:28.13]20. Where can the eclipse be seen?
[17:46.55]21. How long did this total eclipse last?
[18:05.96]Passage Three
[18:07.64]US medicine, the nation¡¯s most conservative profession, 
[18:12.17]is being shaken up. 
[18:14.34]Many medical students and young doctors 
[18:17.20]are determined to change its rules and traditions. 
[18:20.62]Old practices like the one-to-one doctor-patient relationship 
[18:25.95]and the direct fee for service 
[18:28.54]are losing respect. 
[18:30.22]The American Medical Association, 
[18:32.74]traditional foe of any system 
[18:35.71]hinting of collectivism, 
[18:37.48]is losing membership. 
[18:39.36]Yet resistance to change is strong, 
[18:42.74]and no speedy revolution of US medicine is in sight. 
[18:47.25]What is happening amounts to 
[18:48.93]a slow, often painful evolution 
[18:52.12]that is shaping a new kind of doctor. 
[18:55.07]Jeffrey Beckwith, 26, 
[18:57.64]an intern at Bronson Methodist Hospital 
[19:00.81]in Kalamazoo, Michigan, 
[19:02.49]represents only a vocal minority, 
[19:05.74]but his attitudes are significant. 
[19:08.00]He is more like his grandfather than his father, 
[19:11.47]preferring the model of the old general practitioner (GP) 
[19:15.64]to that of the specialist or researcher. 
[19:18.73]He recognizes the inadequacies of the old GP, 
[19:22.71]but thinks that better training can overcome them. 
[19:26.48]He acknowledges the need for specialists, 
[19:29.68]but envisions them as part of a team. 
[19:32.54]¡°Specialists take one organ and ignore everything else,¡± 
[19:37.60]says Jeffrey Beckwith. 
[19:39.00]¡°I want to get it all together.¡±
[19:41.29] He is less interested in solo practice and a big income. 
[19:45.68]But he is ready to seek partnerships, 
[19:48.83]which he values most.
[19:50.94]He is willing to accept government participation in medicine 
[19:55.66]and new types of health insurance schemes. 
[19:58.58]Though only a radical few favor socialization, 
[20:02.72]most see health care as a citizen¡¯s right 
[20:06.31]rather than a privilege. 
[20:08.16]They also realize that the money necessary 
[20:11.18]to assure that right for all 
[20:13.66]and some degree of supervision over its spending 
[20:17.26]will have to come from some level of government.
[20:21.96]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage
[20:27.28]you have just heard.
[20:29.97]22. What happened to US medicine?
[20:50.75]23. What kind of doctor was Jeffrey¡¯s grandfather?
[21:10.94]24. What does Jeffrey value most?
[21:30.70]25. What is people¡¯s attitude to the health care? 
[21:50.71]Section C
[21:52.20]Directions: In this section, 
[21:54.77]you will hear a passage three times. 
[21:57.87]When the passage is read for the first time, 
[22:00.78]you should listen carefully for its general idea. 
[22:04.56]When the passage is read for the second time, 
[22:07.81]you are required to fill in the blanks 
[22:10.70]with the exact words you have just heard. 
[22:13.79]Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, 
[22:18.01]you should check what you have written. 
[22:20.38]Now listen to the passage.
[26:34.79][24:32.59][22:23.86]Research suggests that parental involvement in school 
[26:39.09][24:36.43][22:27.98]is vital to a child¡¯s academic success. 
[26:42.45][24:39.76][22:31.41]However, if you¡¯re a single parent, a working parent, 
[26:46.72][24:43.45][22:35.51]or a parent with little spare time, 
[26:49.30][24:45.99][22:38.14]you may find it difficult 
[26:51.33][24:47.88][22:40.23]to find ways to get involved. 
[26:53.77][24:50.13][22:42.71]The following list of recommendation 
[26:56.54][24:52.74][22:45.48]comes from the Harvard Family Research Project, 
[27:00.04][24:56.02][22:49.04]an organization committed to advancing education, 
[27:04.25][24:59.90][22:53.08]which may give you some enlightenment. 
[27:07.43][25:02.59][22:56.37]First, attend teacher-parent conferences. 
[27:11.02][25:06.60][22:59.90]If the schedule of these meetings 
[27:13.39][25:08.82][23:02.09]conflicts with your work schedule, 
[27:15.43][25:10.84][23:04.24]speak to the teacher and principal about your situation, 
[27:19.74][25:14.68][23:08.55]and work out a time you can meet them. 
[27:22.63][25:17.21][23:11.52]Second, get over your own insecurities. 
[27:26.37][25:20.83][23:15.34]The Harvard Family Research Project found that parents 
[27:30.61][25:24.90][23:19.56]who had negative childhood experiences at school 
[27:34.56][25:28.36][23:23.45]are less likely to get involved in 
[27:37.60][25:30.70][23:26.41]their children¡¯s academic programs, 
[27:40.06][25:33.09][23:29.39]and may feel uncomfortable contacting teachers. 
[27:44.40][25:36.76][23:33.27]Remember that your child¡¯s academic experience 
[27:48.04][25:40.21][23:36.95]is important and vital to his professional success. 
[27:52.24][25:44.44][23:41.04]Don¡¯t let your own obstacles hinder your child¡¯s success. 
[27:56.85][25:48.70][23:45.69]Third, drop in on extracurricular activities. 
[28:01.57][25:53.04][23:50.46]If you are unavailable during the day, 
[28:04.53][25:55.64][23:53.29]try to pick your child up from after-school activities. ª©
[28:08.86][25:59.65][23:57.72]Arrive a few minutes early 
[28:11.08][26:01.88][23:59.94]and watch your child in action. 
[28:13.58][26:04.32][24:02.71]Sit in on your child¡¯s student council meeting or theatre rehearsal. 
[28:18.66][26:09.52][24:07.54]Finally, use a translator.
