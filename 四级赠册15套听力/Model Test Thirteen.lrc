[00:17.37]Model Test Thirteen
[00:21.25]Section A
[00:22.87]Directions: In this section,
[00:25.48]you will hear 8 short conversations
[00:28.43]and 2 long conversations.
[00:31.73]At the end of each conversation,
[00:33.94]one or more questions
[00:35.41]will be asked about what was said.
[00:38.11]Both the conversation
[00:39.77]and the questions will be spoken only once.
[00:44.41]After each question there will be a pause.
[00:47.76]During the pause,
[00:48.72]you must read the four choices marked
[00:51.49]A), B), C), and D),
[00:54.60]and decide which is the best answer.
[00:57.79]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[01:01.94]with a single line through the centre.
[01:04.92]Now let¡¯s begin with the eight short conversations.
[01:10.99]1. M: Shawn¡¯s been trying for months to find a job.
[01:15.65]But I wonder how he could get a job
[01:17.91]when he looks like that.
[01:20.03]W: Oh, that poor guy!
[01:21.79]He really should shave himself every other day at least
[01:25.49]and put on something clean.
[01:28.79]Q: What do we learn about Shawn?
[01:47.78]2. W: I wish Jane would call
[01:50.99]when she knows she¡¯ll be late.
[01:53.11]This is not the first time we¡¯ve had to wait for her.
[01:56.03]M: I agree. But she does
[01:57.92]have to drive through very heavy traffic to get here.
[02:02.60]Q: What does the man imply?
[02:19.80]3. M: Congratulations!
[02:23.91]I heard your baseball team
[02:25.55]is going to the Mid-Atlantic Championships.
[02:29.01]W: Yeah, we¡¯re all working real hard right now!
[02:33.14]Q: What is the woman¡¯s team doing?
[02:51.58]4. W: John¡¯s been looking after
[02:55.16]his mother in the hospital.
[02:57.56]She was injured in a car accident two weeks ago
[03:00.59]and is still in critical condition.
[03:03.38]M: Oh, that¡¯s terrible.
[03:05.59]And you know, his father passed away last year.
[03:09.83]Q: What do we learn about John?
[03:27.34]5. M: What a boring speaker!
[03:32.09]I could hardly stay awake.
[03:34.54]W: Well, I don¡¯t know. In fact,
[03:37.55]I think it¡¯s been a long time
[03:39.65]since I¡¯ve heard anyone as good.
[03:42.06]Q: What do we learn from the conversation?
[03:59.94]6. W: I¡¯m having a lot of trouble with logic,
[04:04.73]and it seems my professor can¡¯t explain it in a way
[04:07.78]that makes sense to me.
[04:09.57]M: You know, there is a tutoring service on campus.
[04:13.14]I was about to drop statistics
[04:15.42]before they helped me out.
[04:18.80]Q: What does the man mean?
[04:36.55]7. M: This is a stylish overcoat.
[04:41.16]I saw you wearing it last week, didn¡¯t I?
[04:44.24]W: Oh, that wasn¡¯t me.
[04:46.30]That was my sister Jill. She¡¯s in your class.
[04:50.32]Q: What does the woman mean?
[05:07.73]8. M: Jane, suppose you lost all your money
[05:12.00]while taking a vacation overseas,
[05:14.78]what would you do?
[05:16.13]W: Well, I guess I¡¯d sell my watch or computer
[05:19.74]or do some odd jobs till
[05:21.70]I could afford a return plane ticket.
[05:25.01]Q: What are the speakers talking about?
[05:43.02]Now you¡¯ll hear the two long conversations.
[05:47.75]Conversation One
[05:50.99]M: Hello, Prof. Johnson.
[05:53.67]W: Hello, Tony. So what shall we work on today?
[05:57.99]M: Well, the problem is that
[05:59.71]this writing assignment isn¡¯t coming out right.
[06:02.88]What I thought I was writing on
[06:04.86]was to talk about what a particular sport means to me
[06:08.33]when I participate in it .


[06:11.14]W: What sport did you choose?
[06:13.52]M: I decided to write about cross-country skiing.
[06:17.90]W: What are you going to say about skiing?
[06:20.60]M: That¡¯s the problem. I thought I would write about
[06:23.74]how peaceful it is to be out in the country.
[06:27.36]W: So why is that a problem?
[06:29.73]M: As I start describing
[06:31.51]how quiet it is to be out in the woods,
[06:34.10]I keep mentioning
[06:35.09]how much effort it takes to keep going.
[06:38.09]Cross-country skiing isn¡¯t as easy
[06:40.21]as some people think.
[06:41.94]It takes a lot of energy,
[06:44.09]but that¡¯s not part of my paper.
[06:46.51]So I guess I should leave it out.
[06:48.90]But now I don¡¯t know
[06:50.43]how to explain that feeling of peacefulness
[06:53.47]without explaining how hard you have to work for it.
[06:57.00]It all fits together.
[06:58.86]It¡¯s not like just sitting down somewhere
[07:01.27]and watching the clouds roll by. That¡¯s different.
[07:05.03]W: Then you¡¯ll have to include that in your point.
[07:09.16]The peacefulness of cross-country skiing
[07:11.20]is the kind you earn by effort.
[07:13.82]Why leave that out?
[07:15.54]Part of your point you knew beforehand
[07:17.87]but part you discovered as you wrote.
[07:19.89]That¡¯s common, right?
[07:22.19]M: Yeah, I guess so.
[07:25.49]Questions 9 to 11 are based on the conversation
[07:28.87]you have just heard.
[07:31.41]9. What is the topic
[07:35.26]of the man¡¯s writing assignment?
[07:52.86]10. What problem does the man have
[07:56.52]while working on his paper?
[08:14.08]11. What does the woman say
[08:17.13]is common in writing papers?
[08:35.50]Conversation Two
[08:37.39]W: Good evening
[08:38.52]and welcome to this week¡¯s ¡°Business World,¡±
[08:41.42]a program for and about business people.
[08:44.40]Tonight we have Mr. Angeleno who came to
[08:47.46]the United States six years ago,
[08:49.58]and is now an established businessman
[08:52.40]with three restaurants in town.
[08:54.67]Tell us, Mr. Angeleno, how did you get started?
[08:57.94]M: Well, I started off with a small diner.

[09:01.04]I did all the cooking myself
[09:03.01]and my wife waited on tables.
[09:05.43]It was really too much work for two people.
[09:08.73]My cooking is great.
[09:10.60]And word got around town about the food.
[09:13.52]Within a year, I had to hire
[09:15.37]another cook and four waitresses.
[09:18.21]When that restaurant became very busy,
[09:21.14]I decided to expand my business.
[09:23.92]Now with three places my main concern is
[09:27.25]keeping the business successful and running smoothly.
[09:30.96]W: Do you advertise?
[09:32.74]M: Oh yes. I don¡¯t have any TV commercials,
[09:36.14]because they are too expensive.
[09:38.13]But I advertise a lot on radio and in local newspapers.
[09:42.86]My children used to distribute ads
[09:45.12]in nearby shopping centers,



[09:47.16]but we don¡¯t need to do that any more.
[09:50.06]W: Why do you believe you¡¯ve been so successful?
[09:53.41]M: Um, I always serve the freshest possible food
[09:57.29]and I make the atmosphere
[09:59.01]as comfortable and as pleasant as I can,
[10:02.37]so that my customers will want to come back.
[10:06.18]W: So you always aim to please the customers?
[10:09.33]M: Absolutely!
[10:10.87]Without them I would have no business at all.
[10:14.59]W: Thank you, Mr. Angeleno.
[10:16.41]I think your advice will be helpful
[10:18.71]to those just staring out in business.
[10:23.22]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation
[10:26.78]you have just heard.
[10:30.19]12. What is the woman¡¯s occupation?
[10:50.17]13. What do we learn about Mr. Angeleno¡¯s business
[10:55.52]at its beginning?
[11:12.32]14. What does Mr. Angeleno say about
[11:16.93]advertising his business?
[11:34.36]15. What does the man say contributes to
[11:39.08]the success of his business?

[11:56.65]Section B
[11:58.33]Directions: In this section,
[12:00.77]you will hear 3 short passages.
[12:04.20]At the end of each passage,
[12:06.45]you will hear some questions.
[12:08.60]Both the passage and the questions
[12:10.31]will be spoken only once.
[12:13.38]After you hear a question,
[12:14.89]you must choose the best answer
[12:17.12]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[12:22.49]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[12:26.27]with a single line through the centre.


[12:30.04]Passage One
[12:32.46]There are many commonly-held beliefs about eye glasses
[12:35.77]and eyesight that are not proven facts.
[12:38.79]For instance, some people believe that
[12:41.57]wearing glasses too soon weakens the eyes.
[12:45.12]But there is no evidence to show that
[12:47.44]the structure of eyes is changed
[12:49.47]by wearing glasses at a young age.
[12:52.41]Wearing the wrong glasses, however, can prove harmful.
[12:56.33]Studies show that for adults there is no danger,
[12:59.94]but children can develop loss of vision
[13:02.82]if they have glasses inappropriate for their eyes.
[13:06.44]We have all heard some of the common myths
[13:08.93]about how eyesight gets bad.
[13:11.50]Most people believe that reading in dim light
[13:14.21]causes poor eyesight,
[13:16.29]but that is untrue.
[13:18.07]Too little light makes the eyes work harder,
[13:21.09]so they do get tired and strained.


[13:24.36]Eye strain also results from reading a lot,
[13:27.79]reading in bed, and watching too much television.
[13:31.38]However, although eye strain
[13:33.31]may cause some pain or headaches,
[13:35.72]it does not permanently damage eyesight.








[13:39.02]Another myth about eyes is that they can be replaced,
[13:43.11]or transferred from one person to another.
[13:46.24]There are close to one million nerve fibers
[13:48.92]that connect the eyeball to the brain,
[13:51.35]as of yet it is impossible to attach them all
[13:54.98]in a new person.
[13:56.45]Only certain parts of the eye can be replaced.
[13:59.57]But if we keep clearing up the myths
[14:01.86]and learning more about the eyes,
[14:03.81]some day a full transplant may be possible.
[14:09.65]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage
[14:13.34]you have just heard.
[14:16.76]16. What does the speaker
[14:20.81]want to tell us about eyesight?




[14:38.30]17. What do studies
[14:41.61]about wearing the wrong glasses show?
[15:00.08]18. What do we learn about eye transplanting
[15:04.26]from the talk?

[15:20.39]Passage Two
[15:22.21]When people care for an elderly relative,
[15:25.33]they often do not use available community services
[15:28.98]such as adult day-care centers.
[15:32.28]If the caregivers are adult children,
[15:34.58]they are more likely to use such services,
[15:37.54]especially because they often have jobs
[15:40.22]and other responsibilities.
[15:42.18]In contrast, a spouse, usually the wife,
[15:45.79]is much less likely to use support services
[15:49.41]or to put the dependent person in a nursing home.
[15:53.13]Social workers discover that
[15:55.18]the wife normally tries
[15:56.88]to take care of her husband herself
[15:59.52]for as long as she can
[16:01.53]in order not to use up their life savings.
[16:04.98]Researchers have found that caring for the elderly
[16:08.71]can be a very positive experience.
[16:11.25]The elderly appreciated the care
[16:13.84]and attention they received.
[16:15.60]They were affectionate and cooperative.
[16:18.48]However, even when care giving is satisfying,
[16:21.93]it is hard work.
[16:23.72]Social workers and experts on aging offer caregivers
[16:27.51]and potential caregivers help
[16:29.34]when arranging for the care of an elderly relative.
[16:33.13]One consideration is to ask parents what they want
[16:36.60]before they become sick or dependent.

[16:39.42]Perhaps they prefer going into a nursing home
[16:42.17]and can select one in advance. On the other hand,
[16:46.02]they may want to live with their adult children.
[16:49.23]Caregivers must also learn to state their needs
[16:52.41]and opinions clearly and ask for help from others,
[16:56.11]especially brothers and sisters.
[16:58.41]Brothers and sisters are often willing to help,
[17:01.37]but they may not know what to do.
[17:06.11]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage
[17:09.46]you have just heard.
[17:12.64]19. Why are adult children more likely to use
[17:18.12]community services to help care for elderly parents?
[17:37.65]20. Why are most wives unwilling to put their
[17:41.78]dependent husbands into nursing homes?
[18:00.16]21. According to the passage,
[18:04.05]what must caregivers learn to do?
[18:22.20]Passage Three
[18:23.80]Since a union representative visited our company
[18:26.97]to inform us about our rights and protections,
[18:30.82]my coworkers have been worrying about health conditions
[18:34.03]and complaining about safety hazards in the workplace.
[18:38.65]Several of the employees in the computer department,
[18:41.47]for example, claim to be developing vision problems
[18:45.13]from having to stare at a video display terminal
[18:48.28]for about seven hours a day.
[18:51.63]The supervisor of the laboratory
[18:53.43]is beginning to get headaches and dizzy spells
[18:56.36]because she says it¡¯s dangerous
[18:58.83]to breathe some of the chemical smoke there.
[19:01.71]An X-ray technician is refusing to do her job
[19:05.63]until the firm agrees to replace its out-dated equipment.
[19:09.91]She insists that it¡¯s exposing workers to
[19:12.69]unnecessarily high doses of radiation.
[19:16.17]She thinks that she may have to contact
[19:18.77]the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
[19:21.83]and ask that government agency
[19:23.97]to inspect the department.
[19:26.12]I¡¯ve heard that at a factory
[19:27.60]in the area two pregnant women
[19:29.59]who were working with paint requested
[19:32.21]a transfer to a safer department,
[19:34.79]because they wanted to prevent damage to
[19:37.31]their unborn babies.
[19:39.61]The supervisor of personnel refused the request.
[19:43.74]In another firm the workers were constantly
[19:46.36]complaining about the malfunctioning heating system,
[19:49.76]but the owner was too busy
[19:51.60]or too mean to do anything about it.
[19:55.19]Finally, they all met and agreed
[19:57.58]to wear ski-clothing to work the next day.
[20:01.39]The owner was too embarrassed to
[20:03.23]talk to his employees.
[20:05.00]But he had the heating system replaced right away.
[20:11.52]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage
[20:15.38]you have just heard.
[20:19.06]22. What does the talk focus on?
[20:40.52]23. What did the X-ray technician
[20:44.72]ask her company to do?
[21:02.57]24. What does the speaker say about
[21:06.38]the two pregnant women working with paint?
[21:25.44]25. Why did the workers in the firm
[21:29.68]wear ski-clothing to work?
[21:48.95]Section C
[21:50.61]Directions: In this section,
[21:53.77]you will hear a passage three times.
[21:56.58]When the passage is read for the first time,
[21:59.09]you should listen carefully for its general idea.
[22:03.00]When the passage is read for the second time,
[22:06.01]you are required to fill in the blanks
[22:08.50]with the exact words you have just heard.
[22:12.10]Finally, when the passage is read for the third time,
[22:15.96]you should check what you have written.


[22:18.80]Now listen to the passage.
[22:21.87]Contrary to the old warning
[22:23.66]that time waits for no one,
[22:26.19]time slows down when you are on the move.
[22:29.28]It also slows down more as you move faster,
[22:33.24]which means astronauts someday
[22:35.09]may survive so long in space
[22:37.46]that they would return to an earth
[22:39.49]of the distant future.
[22:41.32]If you could move at the speed of light,
[22:43.70]your time would stand still.
[22:45.75]If you could move faster than light,
[22:47.89]your time would move backward.
[22:50.55]Although no form of matter yet discovered
[22:53.09]moves as fast as or faster than light,
[22:56.34]scientific experiments have already confirmed
[22:59.33]that accelerated motion causes
[23:01.67]a traveler¡¯s time to be stretched.
[23:04.34]Albert Einstein predicted this in 1905,
[23:08.01]when he introduced the concept of relative time
[23:11.09]as part of his Special Theory of Relativity.
[23:14.76]A search is now under way
[23:16.42]to confirm the suspected existence
[23:18.32]of particles of matter that
[23:20.48]move at a speed greater than light,
[23:23.00]and therefore,
[23:24.11]might serve as our passports to the past.
[23:27.63]An obsession with time¡ªsaving, gaming,
[23:31.12]wasting, losing and mastering it,
[23:33.99]seems to have been a part of humanity
[23:36.29]for as long as humans have existed.
[23:39.07]Humanity also has been obsessed with
[23:41.75]trying to capture the meaning of time.
[23:44.83]Einstein used a definition of time
[23:47.11]for experimental purposes,
[23:49.75]as that which is measured by a clock.
[23:52.66]Thus, time and time¡¯s relativity are measurable
[23:56.42]by any hourglass, alarm clock, or atomic clock
[24:01.18]that can measure a billionth of a second.
[24:06.32]Now the passage will be read again.
[24:11.00]Contrary to the old warning
[24:12.84]that time waits for no one,
[24:15.22]time slows down when you are on the move.
[24:18.42]It also slows down more as you move faster,
[24:22.31]which means astronauts someday
[24:24.13]may survive so long in space that
[24:27.07]they would return to an earth
[24:28.71]of the distant future.
[24:30.34]If you could move at the speed of light,
[24:32.72]your time would stand still.
[24:34.76]If you could move faster than light,
[24:37.01]your time would move backward.
[24:39.34]Although no form of matter yet discovered
[24:42.14]moves as fast as or faster than light,
[24:45.37]scientific experiments have already confirmed
[24:48.26]that accelerated motion causes
[24:50.70]a traveler¡¯s time to be stretched.
[24:53.12]Albert Einstein predicted this in 1905,
[24:57.27]when he introduced the concept of relative time
[25:00.21]as part of his Special Theory of Relativity.
[25:03.83]A search is now under way
[25:05.50]to confirm the suspected existence
[25:07.56]of particles of matter
[25:09.21]that move at a speed greater than light,
[25:11.91]and therefore,
[25:13.15]might serve as our passports to the past.
[25:16.52]An obsession with time¡ªsaving, gaming,
[25:20.18]wasting, losing and mastering it,
[25:22.83]seems to have been a part of humanity
[25:25.45]for as long as humans have existed.
[25:28.31]Humanity also has been obsessed with
[25:30.85]trying to capture the meaning of time.
[25:33.86]Einstein used a definition of time
[25:36.23]for experimental purposes,
[25:38.54]as that which is measured by a clock.
[25:41.77]Thus, time and time¡¯s relativity are measurable
[25:45.53]by any hourglass, alarm clock, or atomic clock
[25:50.03]that can measure a billionth of a second.
[25:54.97]Now the passage will be read for the third time.
[25:59.21]Contrary to the old warning
[26:01.28]that time waits for no one,
[26:03.86]time slows down when you are on the move.
[26:07.27]It also slows down more as you move faster,
[26:10.84]which means astronauts someday
[26:12.75]may survive so long in space that
[26:15.66]they would return to an earth
[26:17.22]of the distant future.
[26:18.95]If you could move at the speed of light,
[26:21.34]your time would stand still.
[26:23.55]If you could move faster than light,
[26:25.65]your time would move backward.
[26:28.03]Although no form of matter yet discovered
[26:30.74]moves as fast as or faster than light,
[26:33.94]scientific experiments have already confirmed
[26:37.16]that accelerated motion causes
[26:39.30]a traveler¡¯s time to be stretched.
[26:41.72]Albert Einstein predicted this in 1905,
[26:45.89]when he introduced the concept of relative time
[26:49.03]as part of his Special Theory of Relativity.
[26:52.49]A search is now under way
[26:53.95]to confirm the suspected existence
[26:56.10]of particles of matter
[26:57.86]that move at a speed greater than light,
[27:00.51]and therefore,
[27:01.74]might serve as our passports to the past.
[27:05.44]An obsession with time¡ªsaving, gaming,
[27:08.86]wasting, losing and mastering it,
[27:11.44]seems to have been a part of humanity
[27:14.07]for as long as humans have existed.
[27:16.84]Humanity also has been obsessed with
[27:19.44]trying to capture the meaning of time.
[27:22.25]Einstein used a definition of time
[27:24.89]for experimental purposes,
[27:27.38]as that which is measured by a clock.
[27:30.27]Thus, time and time¡¯s relativity are measurable
[27:34.11]by any hourglass, alarm clock, or atomic clock
[27:38.73]that can measure a billionth of a second.
[27:43.88]This is the end of listening comprehension.
