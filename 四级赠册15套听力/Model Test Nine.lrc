[00:19.84]Model Test Nine
[00:22.53]Section A
[00:24.29]Directions: In this section,
[00:27.41]you will hear 8 short conversations
[00:30.11]and 2 long conversations.
[00:32.98]At the end of each conversation,
[00:35.74]one or more questions will be asked
[00:38.23]about what was said.
[00:39.92]Both the conversation and the questions
[00:42.85]will be spoken only once.
[00:45.20]After each question there will be a pause.
[00:48.45]During the pause,
[00:50.10]you must read the four choices
[00:52.83]marked A), B), C) and D),
[00:56.67]and decide which is the best answer.
[01:00.20]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[01:04.51]with a single line through the centre.
[01:08.01]Now let¡¯s begin with the eight short conversations.
[01:13.95]1. W: I need to do something to improve
[01:16.89]my spoken French as quickly as possible.
[01:20.27]M: Of course you need.
[01:22.41]The training program in France is coming soon.
[01:25.67]Doesn¡¯t the community college offer something?
[01:28.47]Q: What does the man suggest the woman do?
[01:47.41]2. M: Look at this traffic.
[01:50.24]By the time we get to the gallery,
[01:52.28]we¡¯ll only have an hour to look around before it closes.
[01:56.12]W: You may be right,
[01:57.98]but since we can¡¯t do anything about it,
[02:00.49]we may as well try to relax.
[02:03.06]Q: What does the woman mean?
[02:20.92]3. W: We thought we¡¯d all go out for dinner today.
[02:24.64]Can you be ready to leave at half past five?
[02:27.72]M: I have to pick up my car from the garage
[02:30.64]and do some other things,
[02:32.38]so I¡¯ll just come straight to the restaurant.
[02:35.22]Q: What will the man probably do?
[02:52.83]4. M: Why did you come to the meeting late?
[02:56.83]I left a message with your roommate about the time change.
[03:00.75]W: She has a very short memory,
[03:03.06]and it really gets on my nerves sometimes.
[03:06.53]Q: What does the woman imply?
[03:23.98]5. W: I heard you had a tour in Germany
[03:27.34]and some other European countries.
[03:29.85]Did you get traveler¡¯s checks with you?
[03:32.35]M: Yeah. They are better than carrying
[03:34.42]around a wallet full of big bills.
[03:37.76]Q: What does the man mean?
[03:55.43]6. M: What have you heard about Prof. Steve?
[03:59.74]I¡¯m thinking of taking an advanced mathematics course
[04:02.69]with him next year.
[04:04.37]W: You really should.
[04:05.72]I¡¯ve heard he¡¯s always publishing articles in the journals
[04:09.13]and one of his articles just won some kind of award.
[04:13.39]Q: What does the woman say about Prof. Steve?
[04:32.24]7. M: My friend Jones spent his whole weekend
[04:36.27]helping me move to a new department.
[04:38.82]W: There aren¡¯t many people who would
[04:40.89]put themselves out like that.
[04:43.02]He is indeed a friend.
[04:45.08]Q: What does the woman mean?
[05:02.51]8. W: Will you need a ride to work
[05:05.37]while your car is being repaired in the garage?
[05:08.29]M: Actually, I¡¯m thinking I¡¯d ask Judy.
[05:11.56]She lives closer to me.
[05:13.12]Thanks anyway for your offer.
[05:16.92]Q: What does the man mean?
[05:33.89]Now you'll hear the two long conversations.
[05:37.76]Conversation One
[05:39.98]M: I really can¡¯t stand them anymore!
[05:43.34]W: Who? What happened?
[05:45.12]M: My roommates.
[05:46.18]Two of them keep talking till midnight
[05:48.70]and make it impossible to get to sleep.
[05:51.65]W: I know how you feel.
[05:53.37]It¡¯s never easy to live with inconsiderate roommates.
[05:57.22]I once had a roommate who never cleaned
[06:00.01]the dormitory or fetched water.
[06:02.55]M: So what did you do with her?
[06:05.10]W: At first I tried to ignore it
[06:07.38]because I didn¡¯t want to cause anything unpleasant.
[06:10.37]But things didn¡¯t become any better.
[06:13.39]Suddenly one day I broke out,
[06:15.76]and said something like ¡°My dear fellow,
[06:18.58]I'd really appreciate it if you remember
[06:21.14]to clean the room once in a while.¡±
[06:23.49]M: Oh, no.
[06:24.71]You¡¯ve got to be careful with complaints,
[06:26.98]especially when it comes to your roommates.
[06:29.93]Anyway you meet each other every day.
[06:33.01]W: That¡¯s what I¡¯ve learned from our quarrel
[06:35.46]and the subsequent coldness between us.
[06:38.39]Now I realize that I should have put it nicely or casually,
[06:42.32]something like
[06:43.49]¡°Hi,Cindy, it¡¯s your turn to clean the dormitory today.¡±
[06:47.16]M: Perfect. It¡¯s hard to take offense at something like this.
[06:50.98]Maybe we should learn tolerance and understanding.
[06:54.36]W: That¡¯s right.
[06:55.41]We should bear in mind that we all have shortcomings,
[06:58.96]or rather peculiar habits.
[07:01.20]When I come to think of Cindy,
[07:03.50]she¡¯s really a nice girl except
[07:05.89]being forgetful and careless.
[07:08.10]M: I guess you are right.
[07:09.99]What would you do if you have roommates
[07:12.62]chatting at bedtime every night?
[07:15.17]W: I would talk it over with them,
[07:17.40]of course.
[07:18.14]But I would remember I breathe noisily in my sleep
[07:22.01]and often keep them awake half the night as well.
[07:25.06]M: You do?
[07:26.45]W: No, just an example.
[07:31.02]Questions 9 to 11 are based on the conversation
[07:34.20]you have just heard.
[07:38.20]9. What problem is bothering the man?
[07:57.94]10. What lesson does the woman learn
[08:01.13]from her experience with her roommate?
[08:18.98]11. What is the speakers¡¯ common conclusion
[08:23.27]about dealing with roommate problems?
[08:41.11]Conversation Two
[08:43.42]M: Thanks for coming over,Amy.
[08:45.54]I¡¯d like to talk to you about a research project
[08:48.66]I thought you might be interested in.
[08:50.70]A friend of mine is working in Iowa National Park this summer.
[08:55.38]W: A national park! I¡¯ve always wanted to spend some time out in Iowa.
[09:01.16]M: You¡¯d better hear what project it is about first.
[09:04.63]My friend is working with the red fox population.
[09:08.59]The foxes have been increasing in size lately,
[09:11.68]which is good in theory.
[09:13.63]W: Yeah, but I thought they were in danger of dying out.
[09:17.68]M: Because of the winter tourists,
[09:19.99]paths are created in the snow.
[09:22.38]More red foxes are surviving the harsh winters
[09:25.50]because the paths make it easier for the foxes
[09:28.56]to move around and find food.
[09:30.87]But it turns out that some of them are infected with bacteria.
[09:35.24]W: Oh yeah,
[09:36.07]I heard about that.
[09:37.40]It¡¯s been around for a while.
[09:39.55]M: Yes. And because the red fox population is increasing,
[09:43.68]they¡¯ve been moving more than usual and need more food,
[09:47.91]they begin to hunt in the farm which borders the national park.
[09:51.97]As a result,
[09:53.23]the bacteria have spread to the neighboring farms.
[09:56.30]W: That¡¯s bad news.
[09:58.14]Isn¡¯t that a disease that causes animal abortion?
[10:02.13]M: Yes, and it¡¯s caused a lot of controversy.
[10:05.06]Some of the farmers even want to destroy the red foxes.
[10:09.09]W: That¡¯s awful.
[10:10.43]Have they made much progress with the research?
[10:13.32]M: So far,they have been collecting tissue samples
[10:16.58]from dead foxes to see if the bacteria are present.
[10:20.32]W: I¡¯d really be interested in working on this.
[10:23.24]You know I¡¯ve been researching diseased animal population.
[10:27.45]M: That¡¯s why I thought of you.
[10:32.47]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation
[10:35.88]you have just heard.
[10:40.15]12. What is the man talking about with the woman?
[10:59.93]13. Why is the number of red foxes increasing?
[11:20.99]14. Why do some farmers want to kill red foxes?
[11:41.62]15. Why does the man consider the woman
[11:44.63]suitable for the project?
[12:02.78]Section B
[12:04.08]Directions: In this section,
[12:06.46]you will hear 3 short passages.
[12:09.26]At the end of each passage,
[12:11.32]you will hear some questions.
[12:13.27]Both the passage and the questions
[12:15.47]will be spoken only once.
[12:17.95]After you hear a question,
[12:19.81]you must choose the best answer
[12:21.80]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[12:26.93]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[12:31.08]with a single line through the centre.
[12:34.86]Passage One
[12:37.26]GPS stands for the Global Positioning System.
[12:40.52]It refers to a system of satellites
[12:43.23]and receivers that allows people
[12:45.15]and devices to detect their precise location on the earth.
[12:49.43]The heart of the system relies on 24 satellites
[12:53.29]that orbit the earth twice per day.
[12:56.09]Devices that are equipped
[12:57.92]with GPS equipment receive transmissions
[13:00.87]from at least a few of the satellites
[13:03.10]and are able to collect very precise positioning data.
[13:07.11]The first GPS satellite was launched in 1974
[13:11.63]and the 24th was launched in 1994.
[13:16.06]The system is operated by the United States Department
[13:19.34]of Defense and the use of the system is free for anyone.
[13:24.08]New satellites are periodically launched to replace aging ones.
[13:28.77]As the technology has improved,
[13:31.24]the cost of GPS devices has greatly declined
[13:34.93]while the accuracy has increased.
[13:38.04]Small portable GPS receivers have become very affordable,
[13:42.65]and the accuracy is amazing.
[13:45.45]Accuracy varies based on various factors,
[13:48.96]but it can be as good as a few meters!
[13:52.26]Land-based supplementary devices
[13:54.87]can be used to improve accuracy if higher precision is required.
[14:00.38]The application of the GPS is very broad,
[14:03.96]and as the prices come down the number of users is increasing.
[14:08.82]Portable GPS devices are used by fishermen
[14:12.74]to help them sail around the wild.
[14:15.62]Many new cars are being equipped
[14:18.13]with GPS systems to help drivers find directions.
[14:22.15]The military uses GPS to guide cruise missiles
[14:26.58]to pre-specified targets.
[14:31.36]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage
[14:34.77]you have just heard.
[14:38.77]16. What does GPS refer to?
[14:58.99]17. What do we know about GPS according to the passage?
[15:20.04]18. Why is the use of GPS increasing?
[15:40.91]Passage Two
[15:42.18]While some people seemed to be blessed with beautiful
[15:45.88]and expressive handwriting,
[15:48.06]others spend their entire adult lives wondering
[15:51.10]why their handwriting resembles a child¡¯s clumsy words.
[15:55.74]Fortunately, there are many methods you can use
[15:58.81]to improve your handwriting.
[16:01.09]In today¡¯s computer-driven society,
[16:04.37]opportunities to practice
[16:06.31]and improve your handwriting are few and far between.
[16:10.23]However, regular practice is the most important step
[16:14.87]to improve your handwriting.
[16:16.95]Learning to write is similar to learning how
[16:20.30]to throw a baseball¡ªyou can¡¯t expect perfect results













[16:24.09]on the first try. 
[16:25.88]To improve your handwriting,
[16:27.99]it is helpful to analyze your words to determine 
[16:31.24]what you like and don¡¯t like about your lettering style. 
[16:35.21]Compare your handwriting to the writing of your friends,
[16:38.89]family, and co-workers to see how you measure up. 
[16:43.60]Knowing what areas need improvement 
[16:46.15]will make the process to improve your handwriting much easier. 
[16:50.87]Proper technique is often the key to good handwriting. 
[16:55.50]Research has found that many people 
[16:57.89]who have poor handwriting form the letters with their fingers. 
[17:02.58]They put the full weight of their hand on the paper,
[17:05.96]use the fingers to form the letters,
[17:08.54]and pick the hand up repeatedly to move it across the paper. 
[17:13.29]This results in a tight,
[17:15.06]narrow lettering style that is unable for others to make any sense. 
[17:20.34]To improve your handwriting,
[17:23.10]let your shoulders and forearms do most of the work. 
[17:27.10]Your fingers should only serve as the guides 
[17:30.60]to forming your letters.
[17:34.69]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage
[17:38.09]you have just heard.
[17:40.98]19. What is the main idea of this passage?
[18:02.83]20. What is the similarity between learning to write 
[18:07.07]and throwing a baseball?
[18:24.47]21. What is the writing technique mentioned in the passage?

[18:45.13]Passage Three
[18:47.08]Some countries may have one uniform fishing law 
[18:50.37]covering the entire country,
[18:52.39]while in the United States,
[18:54.00]each state determines its own fishing license policies. 
[18:57.90]There are two main types of fishing licenses. 
[19:01.44]Most people are familiar with the recreational fishing license. 
[19:05.64]It is the one needed simply to enjoy a day 
[19:08.60]on the water with a fishing pole. 
[19:10.88]The other type,
[19:12.21]the commercial fishing license,
[19:14.07]is used by those who depend on fishing for their livelihood. 
[19:18.38]As such, this license is primarily used for salt water fishing. 
[19:23.84]Some states may allow those under a certain age 
[19:27.09]and over a certain age to fish without a license. 
[19:31.34]This is seen as a way to introduce young people 
[19:34.34]to the sport and give seniors a break. 
[19:37.90]The age restrictions are very commonplace among all states,
[19:42.34]though exact ages may vary from location to location. 
[19:47.24]Other exceptions to the fishing license requirements 
[19:50.20]may also be in place. 
[19:53.13]For example, some states say fishing waters 
[19:56.26]located in one¡¯s own county does not require a fishing license. 
[20:01.15]This is to allow those who wish to fish for food 
[20:04.44]to do so without the burdensome requirements of buying a license. 
[20:09.28]In the United States,
[20:11.18]those fishing bordering waters,
[20:13.64]or lakes and rivers between two states,
[20:16.03]usually will only need a fishing license in one state or the other. 
[20:21.43]This is a good benefit. 
[20:23.45]It does not matter which shore you are fishing; 
[20:26.56]the license is just as valid.
[20:30.94]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage
[20:34.65]you have just heard.
[20:38.66]22. In the United States,
[20:42.39]what kind of people needs a recreational fishing license?
[21:02.00]23. Why do some states allow old people to fish without a license?
[21:23.98]24. What is the aim of not requiring a license 
[21:28.11]for people fishing for food?
[21:45.73]25. What is the policy of fishing bordering waters 
[21:50.46]between two states?

[22:08.09]Section C
[22:09.37]Directions: In this section,
[22:12.02]you will hear a passage three times.
[22:15.46]When the passage is read for the first time,
[22:18.18]you should listen carefully for its general idea.
[22:21.60]When the passage is read for the second time,
[22:24.42]you are required to fill in the blanks
[22:27.01]with the exact words you have just heard.
[22:30.33]Finally, when the passage is read for the third time,
[22:33.66]you should check what you have written.
[22:37.16]Now listen to the passage.

[26:58.84][24:49.57][22:40.16]Justice is one of the most popular courses 
[27:01.75][24:52.39][22:42.87]in Harvard¡¯s history. 
[27:03.59][24:54.79][22:45.02]Nearly one thousand students crowd Harvard¡¯s 
[27:06.45][24:57.46][22:47.99]historic Sanders Theatre to hear Prof. Sandel
[27:09.92][25:01.08][22:51.41]talk about justice,
[27:11.82][25:02.69][22:53.40]equality, democracy, and citizenship. 
[27:15.15][25:06.25][22:56.37]Now it¡¯s your turn to take the same journey 
[27:17.89][25:08.94][22:59.07]in moral reflection that has captured 
[27:20.31][25:11.32][23:01.59]more than 14 000 students,
[27:22.74][25:13.88][23:04.14]as Harvard opens its classroom to the world. 
[27:26.51][25:17.51][23:07.74]This course aims to help viewers become more 
[27:29.69][25:20.68][23:10.96]critically minded thinkers about the moral decisions 
[27:33.41][25:24.32][23:14.60]we all face in our everyday lives. 
[27:36.37][25:27.12][23:17.61]Prof. Sandel is a brilliant teacher. 
[27:39.47][25:30.36][23:20.59]He is able,without visible effort,
[27:41.86][25:32.77][23:23.12]to make a lecture to students seem like an intimate dialogue. 
[27:46.03][25:37.04][23:27.21]Sandel is able to conduct remarkably effective dialogues 
[27:50.03][25:40.85][23:30.79]in those large classes,
[27:51.90][25:42.90][23:33.18]like a conductor picking out a piano here. 
[27:55.35][25:46.13][23:36.54]He poses moral dilemmas so acute that one 
[27:58.96][25:49.94][23:40.22]could escape the agony only by thinking.
[28:02.44][25:53.27][23:44.05]In this 12-part series,
[28:04.73][25:55.65][23:45.96]Sandel challenges us with difficult 
[28:07.32][25:58.46][23:48.77]moral dilemmas and asks our opinion 
[28:10.03][26:01.05][23:51.51]about the right thing to do. 
[28:12.43][26:03.31][23:54.00]He then asks us to examine our answers 
[28:15.57][26:06.59][23:56.94]in the light of new situation. 
[28:18.09][26:09.11][23:59.57]The result is often surprising,
[28:21.23][26:11.76][24:02.46]revealing that important moral questions 
[28:23.62][26:14.47][24:04.83]are never black and white. 
[28:25.67][26:16.63][24:07.16]Sorting out these contradictions sharpens our own moral faith 
[28:30.25][26:21.22][24:11.54]and gives us the moral clearness to better understand 
[28:33.95][26:24.64][24:15.11]the opposing views we confront in a democracy. 
[28:37.33][26:28.64][24:18.88]This course also addresses 
[28:39.83][26:30.71][24:20.97]the hot topics of our day¡ªsame sex marriage,
[28:43.39][26:34.43][24:24.70]equal right,
[28:44.77][26:35.72][24:25.85]individualism¡ªand Sandel shows us that we can 
[28:48.54][26:39.52][24:29.69]rethink familiar debates with a fresh perspective. 
[28:52.49][26:43.26][24:34.01]Prof. Sandel believes the process of thinking our way 
[28:56.71][26:47.71][24:37.94]through the moral questions of our day 
[28:58.87][26:49.87][24:40.14]can help make us better citizens.

[24:45.49]Now the passage will be read again.
[26:54.44]Now the passage will be read for the third time.
[29:04.27]This is the end of listening comprehension.
