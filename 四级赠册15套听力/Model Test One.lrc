[00:17.10]Model Test One
[00:19.48]Section A
[00:20.91]Directions: In this section, 
[00:23.08]you will hear 8 short conversations 
[00:25.73]and 2 long conversations. 
[00:28.80]At the end of each conversation, 
[00:31.36]one or more questions will be asked 
[00:33.89]about what was said. 
[00:35.79]Both the conversation and the questions 
[00:39.00]will be spoken only once. 
[00:41.90]After each question there will be a pause. 
[00:45.17]During the pause, 
[00:46.64]you must read the four choices 
[00:48.96]marked A), B), C) and D), 
[00:52.31]and decide which is the best answer. 
[00:55.65]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[01:00.13]with a single line through the centre. 
[01:03.15]Now let¡¯s begin with the eight short conversations.
[01:08.86]1. M: Would you like to 
[01:12.32]go out for dinner with me?
[01:14.31]W: Oh, I¡¯d like to, but I¡¯m busy 
[01:17.26]preparing for my graduation paper.
[01:20.48]Q: What can we learn about the woman?
[01:38.17]2. W:  Did you attend 
[01:40.41]the new English teacher¡¯s oral class?
[01:43.57]M: How she could make her students so active 
[01:46.72]is really impressive.
[01:48.69]Q:  What does the man imply 
[01:50.42]about the new English teacher¡¯s class?
[02:08.61]3. W: Frankly speaking, it never strikes me 
[02:12.71]that you are 40 years old.
[02:15.15]M: Oh, really? A lot of people who meet me, 
[02:18.26]including some friends of mine, 
[02:20.15]think I¡¯m just in my 30s.
[02:22.54]Q: What can we learn about the man?
[02:40.08]4. M: Oh, gosh. I was caught 
[02:43.37]cheating in the math examination yesterday. 
[02:46.35]W: I¡¯m sorry to hear that. 
[02:47.89]But since it happened, 
[02:49.54]you have to face the music.
[02:51.82]Q: What does the woman mean? 
[03:09.47]5. W: Can you spare me some time this week? 
[03:13.53]I missed part of your lecture on 
[03:15.44]Thomas Hardy who is my favorite writer.
[03:18.25]M: OK, we can discuss it Friday afternoon. 
[03:22.22]Q: What is the relationship between the two speakers? 
[03:40.94]6. M: One ten-cent pencil 
[03:44.27]and two ten-cent erasers, please.
[03:47.19]W: OK. That will be 30 cents, 
[03:49.59]and we¡¯ll give you a 10% discount.
[03:52.79]Q: How much money will the man pay? 
[04:10.52]7. W: How about John? 
[04:13.19]Does he recover from the car accident?
[04:16.21]M: It¡¯s hard to say. 
[04:17.63]Physically speaking, he¡¯s fine.
[04:19.93]Q: What can we learn about John?
[04:37.35]8. M: Where were you on Thanksgiving Day, Susan? 
[04:41.64]I dropped by and there was nobody in.
[04:44.91]W: My whole family went to Chicago 
[04:47.16]to visit my Grandpa. 
[04:49.00]It¡¯s our tradition to 
[04:50.42]spend Thanksgiving Day in this way. 
[04:53.35]Q: What can we learn about the woman? 
[05:10.87]Now you¡¯ll hear the two long conversations
[05:15.09]Conversation One
[05:17.04]M: Hi, Helen! Nice to see you again.
[05:19.66]W: Yes, it¡¯s been a while. 
[05:21.38]Hey, you¡¯ve gotten bigger 
[05:23.14]since the last time I saw you.
[05:25.28]M: Yeah, ever since I got married, 
[05:28.17]I¡¯ve been putting on weight. 
[05:30.06]My wife¡¯s a good cook.
[05:32.51]W: You need to start exercising again. 
[05:34.92]Have you thought about 
[05:36.10]joining a health club?
[05:37.92]M: I have. But they are expensive. 
[05:40.37]And I don¡¯t have the time.
[05:41.79]W: I¡¯m a member at Spa Fitness 
[05:44.18]and you¡¯d be surprised at 
[05:45.89]how inexpensive a year membership is. 
[05:49.04]Most of the members are ordinary people 
[05:52.15]who work out for about an hour 
[05:54.67]just three times a week.
[05:56.65]M: Sounds reasonable. 
[05:58.51]I mean, you look skinny enough.
[06:00.90]W: Well, to tell the truth, 
[06:02.62]I haven¡¯t always been this lean. 
[06:05.40]After I turned 30, 
[06:07.26]I started putting on the pounds. 
[06:09.71]I couldn¡¯t fit into my favorite skirts anymore 
[06:13.24]and I didn¡¯t have any energy. 
[06:15.88]So I decided to do exercise. 
[06:18.68]Once you start a regular exercise program, 
[06:22.30]you start feeling better immediately.
[06:25.20]M: Is that right? 
[06:26.60]I read that Americans are getting fatter. 
[06:29.61]In fact, the average American teen is 
[06:32.62]10 to 20 pounds heavier today 
[06:35.05]than in the 1980s. 
[06:37.19]I¡¯m amazed at 
[06:38.48]how many fat teenage girls I see.
[06:41.31]W: That¡¯s because of lifestyle changes. 
[06:43.68]Health clubs aren¡¯t just for beautiful people. 
[06:46.84]Actually, the majority of the members are 
[06:49.76]trying to lose weight like us. 
[06:52.33]So will you join me for a workout?
[06:55.48]I can get you in free of charge tonight 
[06:58.17]with a guest pass.
[06:59.62]M: Why not? I¡¯ve got nothing to lose. 
[07:02.26]W: Nothing but a few pounds.
[07:04.76]Questions 9 to 11 are based on the conversation 
[07:09.61]you have just heard.
[07:12.65]9. Why does the man put on weight?
[07:32.38]10. What can we infer about the woman?
[07:52.21]11. How can the man get into the health club tonight?
[08:12.78]Conversation Two
[08:14.67]M: I need a haircut. 
[08:16.07]But you look pretty busy today. 
[08:18.32]Do you have an opening for me?
[08:20.23]W: Yes, we do. 
[08:21.56]I can cut your hair right now 
[08:23.56]if you like. 
[08:24.81]Do you need a shampoo too? 
[08:26.92]Or just a haircut? 
[08:28.50]M: Just a haircut. 
[08:30.03]I washed my hair this morning. 
[08:32.28]W: Alright. I will have an assistant 
[08:34.67]wet your hair. 
[08:35.83]Then I can start. 
[08:37.41]Please step over there. 
[08:39.44]How would you like to 
[08:40.53]have your hair cut today?
[08:42.24]M: Well, I had a haircut 
[08:44.61]eight weeks ago. 
[08:45.98]So my hair is pretty long. 
[08:48.38]However, I want the same style 
[08:51.26]as the last time.
[08:52.85]W: I recommend you 
[08:54.01]leave it a little long on top. 
[08:56.37]But we should take in 
[08:57.92]the back and sides a bit more. 
[09:00.32]That¡¯s more fashionable now.
[09:02.34]M: Alright. You are the expert. 
[09:04.99]I¡¯m happy to have your recommendation.
[09:07.51]W: And do you usually part your hair along here? 
[09:10.91]M: Yes. 
[09:12.18]W: Alright, I know just what to do. 
[09:14.60]Your hair seems quite dry, you know. 
[09:17.02]And I see some split ends.
[09:19.38]M: Yes, I know my hair is quite thin. 
[09:22.68]It runs in my family. 
[09:24.39]Everybody has very thin hair.
[09:27.14]W: The problem is the split ends. 
[09:29.16]They make your hair look frizzy.
[09:31.47]M: I don¡¯t know what to do with it.
[09:33.59]W: Well, it¡¯s easy. Don¡¯t blow-dry your hair 
[09:36.45]for so long after you shower. 
[09:38.71]Let it dry naturally, 
[09:40.38]then you won¡¯t get split ends.
[09:42.27]M: Oh really? I will try. Thanks.
[09:45.65]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation 
[09:50.98]you have just heard.
[09:53.95]12. What will the woman do 
[09:56.41]before cutting the man¡¯s hair?
[10:13.84]13. What¡¯s the problem of the man¡¯s hair?
[10:33.25]14. What causes this hair problem?
[10:52.30]15. What does the woman suggest the man do 
[10:56.31]to deal with his hair problem?
[11:13.66]Section B
[11:14.87]Directions: In this section, 
[11:17.18]you will hear 3 short passages. 
[11:20.09]At the end of each passage, 
[11:22.10]you will hear some questions. 
[11:24.34]Both the passage and the questions 
[11:26.87]will be spoken only once. 
[11:29.53]After you hear a question, 
[11:31.56]you must choose the best answer 
[11:33.95]from the four choices 
[11:35.45]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[11:38.49]Then mark the corresponding letter 
[11:41.18]on Answer Sheet 1 
[11:43.12]with a single line through the centre.
[11:46.47]Passage One
[11:48.05]How did the first sliced bread 
[11:50.53]and other famous foods 
[11:52.06]get their names? 
[11:53.40]It has been a mystery 
[11:54.85]for a long time. 
[11:56.80]Some researchers have decided to 
[11:59.13]compile the answers 
[12:00.78]and finally there is a surprising story 
[12:03.71]behind the brand name. 
[12:05.49]Consumers had long been slicing bread themselves 
[12:09.54]and any store-bought bread 
[12:11.57]before the late 1920s was unsliced, 
[12:15.28]and people could just bite on the loaf. 
[12:18.52]Even Wonder Bread wasn¡¯t sliced at first. 
[12:21.90]Created in 1921 by the Taggart Baking Company of Indianapolis, Indiana, 
[12:28.63]the new bread was almost ready for market 
[12:32.17]when the question of a name arose. 
[12:34.76]Making a striking name for its new bread 
[12:37.81]was really a tough question. 
[12:40.03]Vice president Elmer Cline happened to 
[12:43.27]attend a balloon race one day.
[12:45.94]The sight of dozens of 
[12:47.71]brightly-colored hot-air balloons in the sky 
[12:50.87]filled him with, as he later said, ¡°wonder.¡± 
[12:54.53]And afterwards, Wonder Bread was born. 
[12:57.94]Cline, in fact, was so impressed with 
[13:01.21]the sight of those balloons 
[13:02.89]that he covered his new product¡¯s wrapper 
[13:05.67]with red, yellow and blue balloons, 
[13:09.49]which is still Wonder¡¯s package design today. 
[13:13.56]You might think that 
[13:15.06]a product combining balloons, bread 
[13:18.05]and a sense of wonder 
[13:19.87]wouldn¡¯t get any better. 
[13:21.90]But in 1933, Wonder introduced the very first 
[13:26.66]pre-sliced loaf of bread 
[13:28.94]to American consumers, 
[13:31.05]the popularity of which is reflected in that phrase¡ª
[13:34.92]¡°the best thing since sliced bread.¡±
[13:39.38]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage 
[13:43.38]you have just heard.
[13:46.92]16. What can we learn about the bread 
[13:50.92]before the late 1920s?
[14:08.61]17. Where did Wonder Bread get its name?
[14:28.19]18. What does the package design 
[14:31.64]of Wonder Bread today look like?
[14:49.46]Passage Two
[14:51.08]In 1967, American Vogue magazine published an article 
[14:56.39]called ¡°Can Great Skin Be Created?¡± 
[14:59.41]written by Beauty editor Carol Phillips 
[15:02.64]with Dr. Norman Orentreich, 
[15:05.24]discussing the significance of a skin care routine. 
[15:09.04]Evelyn Lauder, daughter in-law of Est¨¦e Lauder, 
[15:13.40]read the article and brought it to Est¨¦e¡¯s attention. 
[15:17.21]Both Carol Phillips and Dr. Orentreich were recruited to 
[15:21.96]help create the brand, 
[15:23.64]and in August, 1968, 
[15:26.31]Clinique emerged as the world¡¯s first 
[15:29.28]hypo-allergenic, skin care line at Saks Fifth Avenue. 
[15:34.63]Clinique tests its product for allergic reactions 
[15:38.15]by applying it to 600 people 12 times, 
[15:42.66]with a standard of zero reactions. 
[15:45.49]There are three formulas available 
[15:48.13]in North America and Europe¡ª
[15:50.31]extra-mild, mild, and oily. 
[15:53.16]Clinique also has a facial care line called CX 
[15:57.44]which contains products 
[15:59.05]targeted on specialized needs, 
[16:01.97]such as stretch marks associated with pregnancy. 
[16:05.75]Clinique also carries a skin care line 
[16:08.82]targeted on men. 
[16:10.79]Although mostly known as a skin care line, 
[16:14.38]52% of revenue for Clinique is derived from their makeup, 
[16:19.64]25% from foundation alone. 
[16:23.09]Clinique also carries a line of makeup brushes 
[16:26.85]coated with an antibacterial solution.
[16:30.04]Happy, Clinique¡¯s best-selling women¡¯s fragrance, 
[16:33.97]was introduced in 1997. 
[16:36.61]It features mixture of ruby red grapefruit, bergamot, 
[16:41.35]Hawaiian wedding flower, and spring mimosa. 
[16:44.80]Recently, Clinique announced a partnership with Allergan, 
[16:49.03]the maker of Botox and former partner of Elizabeth Arden, 
[16:53.40]with the result being a new line 
[16:55.66]called Clinique Medical. 
[16:57.78]The line is only available in physician¡¯s offices. 
[17:01.86]The five-product set is designed for 
[17:04.68]pre- and post-operation skin care, 
[17:07.67]and targets on complications 
[17:09.76]such as redness, tightness, burning, irritation and discoloration. 
[17:16.85]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage 
[17:20.56]you have just heard.
[17:22.97]19. What is Clinique?
[17:41.27]20. What do we know about the revenue for Clinique?
[18:00.26]21. What can we learn about Clinique Medical line?
[18:19.42]Passage Three
[18:22.46]As we all know, there are many differences 
[18:25.07]lying between high school and college. 
[18:28.03]For some students, 
[18:29.68]one of the biggest differences is 
[18:31.70]the amount and depth of research 
[18:34.19]that is required for research papers. 
[18:36.91]College professors expect students to 
[18:40.00]be quite adept at researching, 
[18:42.58]and for some students, 
[18:44.05]this is a big change from high school. 
[18:47.09]This is not to say that 
[18:48.70]high school teachers don¡¯t do a great job 
[18:51.69]to prepare their students for college level research¡ª
[18:54.91]quite the contrary! 
[18:56.91]Teachers in high school 
[18:58.57]play a tough and essential role 
[19:01.16]in teaching students how to research and write, 
[19:04.91]and college professors simply require students 
[19:08.42]to take that skill to a new level. 
[19:11.29]For example, you may soon discover that 
[19:14.86]many college professors won¡¯t accept encyclopedia articles 
[19:19.36]as research sources. 
[19:21.68]Encyclopedias are great for finding 
[19:24.30]a compact, informative accumulation of research 
[19:28.50]on a specific topic.
[19:30.32]They are a great resource for finding the basic facts, 
[19:34.63]but they are limited 
[19:36.28]when it comes to offering interpretations of the facts. 
[19:40.33]Professors require students to 
[19:43.06]dig a little deeper than that, 
[19:45.20]accumulate their own evidence from broader sources, 
[19:48.87]and form opinions about their sources 
[19:51.78]as well as the specific topics. 
[19:54.72]For this reason, 
[19:56.11]college-bound students should become familiar with 
[19:59.68]the library and all its terms, rules and methods. 
[20:04.00]They should also have the confidence to 
[20:06.72]venture outside the comfort of the local public library 
[20:11.04]and explore more diverse resources.
[20:16.62]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage 
[20:20.98]you have just heard.
[20:24.11]22. What is the big change from high school to college 
[20:30.54]for some students?
[20:47.33]23. What do high school teachers usually do 
[20:52.32]according to the passage?
[21:08.93]24. Why shouldn¡¯t encyclopedias be used 
[21:14.27]as research sources?
[21:31.22]25. What do professors ask students to do 
[21:35.97]when doing research?
[21:52.11]Section C
[21:54.45]Directions: In this section, 
[21:56.89]you will hear a passage three times. 
[21:59.97]When the passage is read for the first time, 
[22:02.96]you should listen carefully for its general idea. 
[22:06.69]When the passage is read for the second time, 
[22:09.88]you are required to fill in the blanks 
[22:12.82]with the exact words you have just heard. 
[22:15.90]Finally, when the passage is read 
[22:18.33]for the third time, 
[22:20.09]you should check what you have written. 
[22:22.49]Now listen to the passage.
[27:03.00][24:43.73][22:25.47]Elinor Ostrom is an American political scientist. 
[27:07.19][24:47.74][22:29.54]She was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize 
[27:10.78][24:51.47][22:33.18]in Economic Sciences,
[27:12.75][24:53.52][22:35.16] which she shared with Oliver E. Williamson, 
[27:15.96][24:56.42][22:38.36]for ¡°her analysis of economic governance, 
[27:19.45][24:59.92][22:41.75]especially the commons.¡± 
[27:21.62][25:02.13][22:43.91]She is the first woman to 
[27:23.27][25:03.80][22:45.60]win the prize in this category. 
[27:25.70][25:05.98][22:48.15]Ostrom lives in Bloomington, Indiana, 
[27:29.05][25:09.17][22:51.41]and is on the faculty of 
[27:30.72][25:11.02][22:53.11]both Indiana University and Arizona State University. 
[27:35.88][25:16.00][22:58.28]In 1973, she co-founded the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis 
[27:43.47][25:23.65][23:05.97]at Indiana University with her husband, Vincent Ostrom. 
[27:48.28][25:28.39][23:10.75]Examining the use of collective action, trust and cooperation 
[27:53.46][25:33.80][23:15.85]in the management of common pool resources, 
[27:56.43][25:37.09][23:18.80]her institutional approach to public policy, 
[27:60.00][25:40.45][23:22.46]known as the institutional analysis and development (IAD) framework, 
[28:06.05][25:46.36][23:28.49]has been considered sufficiently distinct to 
[28:09.23][25:49.60][23:31.63]be thought of as a separate school of Public Choice Theory. 
[28:13.36][25:54.46][23:35.74]She has authored many books in the fields of 
[28:16.26][25:57.53][23:38.67]organizational theory, political science, and public administration. 
[28:22.30][26:03.11][23:44.58]Ostrom is considered one of the leading scholars 
[28:26.08][26:06.75][23:48.46]in the study of common pool resources. 
[28:28.94][26:09.66][23:51.55]In particular, Ostrom¡¯s work emphasizes 
[28:33.18][26:13.41][23:55.28]how humans interact with ecosystems 
[28:36.53][26:16.82][23:58.94]to maintain long-term sustainable resource yields.
