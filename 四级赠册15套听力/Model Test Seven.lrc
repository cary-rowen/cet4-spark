[00:19.31]Model Test Seven
[00:22.90]Section A
[00:24.47]Directions: In this section,
[00:27.56]you will hear 8 short conversations
[00:30.25]and 2 long conversations.
[00:33.35]At the end of each conversation,
[00:35.84]one or more questions will be asked
[00:38.44]about what was said.
[00:40.26]Both the conversation and the questions
[00:42.93]will be spoken only once.
[00:45.78]After each question there will be a pause.
[00:48.65]During the pause,
[00:50.38]you must read the four choices
[00:52.95]marked A), B), C) and D),
[00:56.70]and decide which is the best answer.
[01:00.12]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[01:04.35]with a single line through the centre.
[01:07.82]Now let¡¯s begin with the eight short conversations.
[01:14.29]1. W: My niece¡¯s birthday party is to be held tomorrow.
[01:18.92]I would like to buy her a schoolbag.
[01:21.58]Do you think it¡¯s a good gift for a girl of 16?
[01:25.79]M:  Something fashionable is much better than that,
[01:29.16]I think.
[01:30.53]Q: What does the man suggest the woman do for her niece?
[01:49.96]2. W: Oh, my goodness! It¡¯s so hot and stuffy these days.
[01:55.19]It¡¯s hard for me to breathe and I almost choke.
[01:58.98]M: Yes.
[02:00.02]But the weather forecast said it would rain the day after tomorrow.
[02:04.52]Let¡¯s just wait.
[02:06.51]Q: What do we learn from the conversation?
[02:28.48]3. W: I¡¯m a new international student.
[02:32.03]Can you tell me how to open a bank account in the US?
[02:35.91]M:  You should provide certain proof or document.
[02:39.37]A letter from your college or a passport is enough.
[02:43.55]Q: What can be inferred about the woman from the conversation?
[03:02.79]4. W: The French test I took this morning is too difficult for me.
[03:08.77]I might have failed it.
[03:10.66]M: Don¡¯t be so pessimistic.
[03:12.92]You have been so hard working
[03:14.91]and did quite well in your language learning.
[03:18.52]Q: What does the man say about the woman?
[03:36.34]5. W: Do you hear that Prof. Smith
[03:39.76]is going back to his own country next week?
[03:43.04]Some students are preparing a farewell party for him.
[03:46.48]M: No. What a pity. His lectures on human psychology are my favorite!
[03:52.90]Q: What do we learn about Prof. Smith?
[04:11.23]6. W: Congratulations!
[04:14.77]I¡¯ve just got the news that you are promoted to manager
[04:18.29]of the Washington branch of our company.
[04:21.10]M: Thank you.
[04:22.04]But there is so much pressure and I feel a little bit nervous.
[04:26.48]Q: What does the man mean?
[04:43.89]7. W: I stayed up quite late last night for my term paper.
[04:48.66]M: So did I at the end of last term.
[04:51.62]It is a very bad habit to wait until the due time
[04:55.18]to finish our assignment.
[04:57.44]Q: What is the man¡¯s opinion on doing their paper?
[05:15.91]8. W: What would you do if you were on a deserted island
[05:20.68]like Robinson Crusoe£¿
[05:22.59]M: I wouldn¡¯t make a living on my own there.
[05:25.52]I would try my best to send signals to get help.
[05:29.61]Q: What does the man mean?
[05:47.02]Now you'll hear the two long conversations.
[05:52.61]Conversation One
[05:54.75]W: I¡¯ve just got some good news.
[05:57.19]Mary has had her baby.
[05:59.02]M: Oh, really? When did she have it?
[06:02.09]Is it a boy or a girl?
[06:04.02]W: Yesterday. It is a girl.
[06:06.25]M: Our daughter was also born on the tenth of October.
[06:10.07]I think the two girls can celebrate their birthday together.
[06:14.18]W: Yes. And she weighed four and a quarter kilos
[06:17.94]when she was born.
[06:19.56]She¡¯s quite a big baby.
[06:21.38]M: You know we should go and visit them in hospital.
[06:24.81]What about tomorrow afternoon at 3:00?
[06:28.30]W: OK. What should we take?
[06:30.34]We must take them something special.
[06:33.14]M: I always think flowers are good to take
[06:35.91]to someone in hospital, don¡¯t you?
[06:38.36]W: Well, people always bring flowers and they don¡¯t last.
[06:42.78]I think it¡¯s much better to take a pot plant,
[06:45.69]so she can take it home with her.
[06:48.13]M: Yes, but then she has to remember to water it.
[06:51.51]What about a big box of chocolates?
[06:54.59]W: That sounds fine.
[06:56.02]We should also bring something to the baby.
[06:58.86]What do you think?
[07:00.18]M: What about a baby carrier?
[07:02.62]Or we could get a little hat,
[07:04.79]or something else.
[07:06.50]W: We don¡¯t know the size,
[07:07.87]or the right color, do we?
[07:10.24]I¡¯d prefer a soft toy, for example, a Teddy Bear.
[07:13.65]The girl can play with it for a long time.
[07:16.56]M: That¡¯s a good idea.
[07:18.49]It is already 3 o¡¯clock.
[07:20.69]Let¡¯s go shopping right now.
[07:23.02]W: All right. Let¡¯s go.
[07:27.06]Questions 9 to 11 are based on the conversation
[07:30.10]you have just heard.
[07:34.24]9. What do the two speakers say about the newly-born baby?
[07:55.10]10. What will the two speakers bring to Mary?
[08:14.43]11. What are the two speakers planning to do now?
[08:35.25]Conversation Two
[08:37.08]W: Excuse me,
[08:38.37]I¡¯ve already done my registration.
[08:40.80]I want to know what we should do today as far as
[08:43.70]the orientation program is concerned.
[08:46.47]M: 	Here is a booklet which tells you today¡¯s activities.
[08:50.11]On the first page,
[08:51.39]there¡¯s an outline of this morning¡¯s activities.
[08:54.46]The program starts at 10 o¡¯clock.
[08:56.89]All the new students will gather in the Main Hall
[08:59.83]to meet the principal and the rest of the staff.
[09:03.27]W: Could you tell me how to get there?
[09:06.37]M: I¡¯ll show you the way in a minute.
[09:08.48]Let¡¯s run through this morning¡¯s events first.
[09:11.33]W: I¡¯ll try to remember.
[09:12.92]M: The principal¡¯s welcome speech will last about 20 minutes
[09:16.99]and then the director of studies will talk to you
[09:19.92]about the courses and the different requirements for each.
[09:23.77]It will help you to select your compulsory and optional courses.
[09:28.66]That¡¯s very important for freshmen.
[09:31.11]It will last 40 minutes.
[09:33.53]W: Is that all?
[09:34.80]Then are we free to walk round the campus?
[09:37.65]M: No! Just hold a second.
[09:40.17]After that, at 11:30,
[09:42.60]for your convenience on campus,
[09:44.51]the student advisor will tell you about the various services
[09:48.20]and activities we offer to students.
[09:51.13]Then it¡¯s free time till 3 o¡¯clock in the afternoon.
[09:55.09]W: What about this afternoon?
[09:57.13]M: This afternoon,
[09:58.14]you¡¯ll take a placement test on your second language,
[10:01.57]so that we can put you in the right class.
[10:04.21]It won¡¯t be too hard for you.
[10:08.94]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation
[10:12.60]you have just heard.
[10:16.16]12. What are the two speakers talking about?
[10:36.41]13. What does the man say about the courses?
[10:56.78]14. What will the student advisor do?
[11:16.45]15. What will the students do in the afternoon?
[11:37.30]Section B
[11:38.51]Directions: In this section,
[11:41.01]you will hear 3 short passages.
[11:43.85]At the end of each passage,
[11:45.89]you will hear some questions.
[11:48.06]Both the passage and the questions
[11:50.13]will be spoken only once.
[11:52.32]After you hear a question,
[11:54.40]you must choose the best answer
[11:56.75]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[12:01.31]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[12:05.49]with a single line through the centre.
[12:09.21]Passage One
[12:10.98]When John Milton,
[12:12.52]writer of Paradise Lost,
[12:14.38]entered Cambridge University in 1625,
[12:18.02]he was already skilled in Latin
[12:20.60]after seven years of studying it
[12:23.14]as his second language at St. Paul¡¯s school, London.
[12:27.77]Like all English boys who prepared for college
[12:30.85]in grammar school,
[12:32.15]he had learned not only to read Latin but also
[12:35.67]to speak and write it fluently and correctly.
[12:39.79]His pronunciation of Latin was English,
[12:43.09]however, and seemed to have sounded strange
[12:46.09]to his friends when he later visited Italy.
[12:49.65]Schoolboys gained their skill in Latin in a bitter way.
[12:54.36]They memorized rules to make learning by heart easier.
[12:59.49]They first made a word-for-word translation
[13:02.96]and then a idiomatic translation into English.
[13:06.62]As they increased their skill,
[13:09.14]they translated their English back into Latin
[13:12.28]without referring to the book
[13:14.47]and then compared their translation with the original.
[13:18.44]The schoolmaster was always at hand to encourage them.
[13:23.23]All schoolmasters believed Latin should be beaten in.
[13:27.96]After several years of study,
[13:30.74]the boys began to write compositions in imitation
[13:34.76]of the Latin writers they read.
[13:36.76]And as they began to read Latin poems,
[13:41.18]they began to write poems in Latin.
[13:44.27]Because Milton was already a poet at ten,
[13:48.08]his poems were much better than those painfully
[13:52.20]put together by other boys.
[13:54.64]During the seven years Milton spent at the university,
[13:59.19]he made constant use of his command of Latin.
[14:02.85]He wrote some excellent Latin poems
[14:06.02]which he published among his works in 1645.
[14:13.01]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage
[14:16.84]you have just heard.
[14:20.70]16. What do we learn about Milton?
[14:40.08]17. Why did schoolmasters believe Latin should be beaten in?
[15:00.85]18. Why were Milton¡¯s poems in Latin better than other boys¡¯?
[15:21.85]Passage Two
[15:23.67]According to a new study,
[15:25.60]low-income smokers in New York spend 25 percent
[15:29.27]of their income on cigarettes.
[15:31.76]The study led advocates for smokers¡¯ rights to say
[15:35.33]it proved high taxes were unsatisfactory and ineffective.
[15:40.21]Using state data,
[15:42.32]the study showed a need to help more poor New Yorkers
[15:45.75]to quit smoking or never start smoking.
[15:48.92]New York has the nation¡¯s highest cigarette taxes.
[15:53.29]In New York,
[15:54.60]a pack of cigarettes can cost $12.
[15:57.91]It is far beyond many smokers¡¯ purchasing ability,
[16:01.67]and they have turned to buying cheaper cigarettes
[16:04.65]online or to using roll-your-own devices.
[16:08.45]According to the state statistics,
[16:11.05]smokers earning less than $30 000 a year paid 39 percent
[16:16.67]of state and city taxes on cigarettes.
[16:19.88]Other studies showed that lower-income smokers
[16:23.43]had less success at quitting.
[16:25.51]When low-income smokers tried to quit,
[16:28.71]they were hindered by being surrounded by many smokers
[16:32.42]and having less cash to buy stop-smoking aids.
[16:36.36]Cigarette taxes were punitive.
[16:39.45]The government put forward the theory
[16:41.91]that high taxes equalled submission to their measure.
[16:45.72]However, this theory is only true superficially,
[16:49.98]but false in nature.
[16:51.99]Many people criticize those in government
[16:55.30]who oppose smoking and increase related taxes in the meantime.
[17:00.00]Some people argue that tax increases
[17:03.16]and other programs are helping more people to quit.
[17:06.77]For example, New York is promoting
[17:09.85]a number of antismoking initiatives.
[17:12.52]The initiatives include targeted media campaigns
[17:16.17]that are designed to reduce the smoking rate
[17:18.95]among lower-income groups and that prevent young people
[17:22.81]from becoming smokers.
[17:27.51]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage
[17:30.35]you have just heard.
[17:34.92]19. What do we learn from the new study?
[17:54.30]20. Why was it difficult for low-income smokers to quit smoking?
[18:15.24]21. Why do many people blame those in the government?
[18:36.12]Passage Three
[18:38.27]Stress is a very normal part of life.
[18:41.73]Most people feel stressed at some time in their lives.
[18:45.61]It doesn¡¯t come from an event itself,
[18:48.44]that is,
[18:49.08]from the things that are happening in our lives.
[18:52.37]It comes from the meaning we give to what has happened.
[18:56.43]We can experience stress any time we feel we don¡¯t have control.
[19:01.64]It can¡¯t come from a feeling
[19:03.61]that we can do anything about a situation.
[19:07.13]Stress is not just caused by our mental or emotional condition.
[19:12.08]It is also influenced by how tired we are,
[19:16.13]whether we have a balanced diet with enough vitamins and minerals,
[19:20.34]whether we get enough physical exercise and whether we can relax.
[19:26.30]If we feel stressed,
[19:28.09]there are several things that we can do.
[19:30.80]First, we need to learn how to relax
[19:34.07]and breathe slowly and smoothly.
[19:36.97]We can also take some time out of our worried,
[19:40.86]busy schedule to notice the small things in life.
[19:44.87]Smell the air,
[19:46.19]look at the flowers,
[19:48.20]notice the small designs in the leaves on a tree¡ª
[19:52.09]these activities can do much to quieten us and
[19:55.99]to give ourselves a small break in a busy schedule.
[19:59.84]We need to take care of our bodies.
[20:03.06]Being tired makes it easier for us to get sick
[20:06.69]and to develop physical problems related to stress.
[20:10.92]We need to get enough rest,
[20:13.37]eat well,
[20:14.44]and do some regular exercise.
[20:17.45]Finally, we need to find what is causing the stress in our lives.
[20:22.94]Once we have found it,
[20:24.42]we need to begin to change that part of our lives.
[20:28.84]If we believe that we can control stress,
[20:32.33]we can begin to control our lives.
[20:38.47]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage
[20:42.19]you have just heard.
[20:46.50]22. What does the speaker want to convey in this passage?
[21:07.56]23. What is stress caused by?
[21:27.42]24. What can we do to lessen stress in life?
[21:47.92]25. What should we do after we find the cause of stress?
[22:09.47]Section C
[22:10.57]Directions: In this section,
[22:13.38]you will hear a passage three times.
[22:16.23]When the passage is read for the first time,
[22:19.35]you should listen carefully for its general idea.
[22:22.87]When the passage is read for the second time,
[22:25.81]you are required to fill in the blanks
[22:28.30]with the exact words you have just heard.
[22:31.03]Finally, when the passage is read for the third time,
[22:35.15]you should check what you have written.
[22:38.51]Now listen to the passage.
[26:43.63][24:42.88][22:41.74]You¡¯ve been working out regularly for quite a while,
[26:47.29][24:46.14][22:45.18]but you¡¯re nowhere near your fitness goals.
















[26:50.85][24:49.56][22:48.58]So now it¡¯s time to bring in your ultimate weapon¡ªyour mind. 
[26:55.20][24:54.06][22:52.85]Rather than thinking of fitness as something mysterious 
[26:58.50][24:57.57][22:56.48]that you do with your body,
[27:00.25][24:59.31][22:57.88]take an analytical,
[27:02.09][25:00.99][22:59.73]goal-oriented approach to making physical improvements that stick. 
[27:06.64][25:05.48][23:04.54]Try these tips for creating a smart fitness plan: define your goals. 
[27:13.30][25:12.27][23:11.00]Whether it¡¯s to lose fat or gain muscle,
[27:16.52][25:15.56][23:14.37]it¡¯s vital to have a goal to work toward. 
[27:19.80][25:18.73][23:17.74]Knowing where you¡¯re going makes it easier to take the right steps. 
[27:24.70][25:23.60][23:22.68]Get realistic. 
[27:26.76][25:25.70][23:24.44]Training gains are met through consistent effort over a period of time. 
[27:32.01][25:30.98][23:29.62]Don¡¯t expect dramatic,
[27:34.29][25:33.42][23:32.10]overnight results. 
[27:35.78][25:34.82][23:33.73]Reward yourself for all the little positive steps you take 
[27:40.01][25:38.93][23:37.66]and for consistently striving forward. 
[27:43.15][25:42.19][23:40.97]Be yourself. 
[27:45.22][25:44.25][23:43.12]Work toward a goal that you can achieve with your body. 
[27:49.05][25:47.98][23:46.81]Don¡¯t try to change your basic shape or 
[27:52.44][25:51.57][23:50.13]to go against your own unique physical capabilities. 
[27:56.14][25:55.50][23:53.81]Take an objective look at yourself,
[27:58.99][25:58.12][23:56.81]then work toward enhancing what you¡¯ve got rather 
[28:03.02][26:01.86][24:00.74]than trying to attain someone else¡¯s body. 
[28:06.34][26:05.37][24:04.03]Identify your weaknesses,
[28:08.86][26:07.92][24:06.56]then use your brain to defeat them. 
[28:11.75][26:10.70][24:09.34]Many people avoid their weak points or bad habits,
[28:15.78][26:14.62][24:13.60]hoping that they can ignore them. 
[28:18.31][26:17.36][24:16.03]Instead, take them up as clues to how you can improve. 
[28:23.22][26:22.11][24:20.77]Keep a food and fitness journal for a month. 
[28:26.74][26:25.73][24:24.54]Then analyze it for negative patterns. 
[28:30.23][26:29.05][24:27.69]If you always overeat late at night,
[28:33.30][26:32.30][24:31.02]try going to a late-night movie to get your mind off food.


[24:38.29]Now the passage will be read again.
[26:39.20]Now the passage will be read for the third time.
[28:41.10]This is the end of listening comprehension.
