[00:17.44]Model Test Fifteen
[00:21.09]Section A
[00:22.68]Directions: In this section,
[00:25.29]you will hear 8 short conversations
[00:28.09]and 2 long conversations.
[00:31.46]At the end of each conversation,
[00:33.85]one or more questions will be asked 
[00:36.18]about what was said.
[00:37.86]Both the conversation and the questions 
[00:40.81]will be spoken only once.
[00:44.24]After each question there will be a pause.
[00:47.58]During the pause, you must read the four choices
[00:50.86]marked A), B), C) and D), 
[00:54.34]and decide which is the best answer.
[00:57.67]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[01:01.79]with a single line through the centre.
[01:04.84]Now let's begin with the eight short conversations.

[01:10.82]1. W: Just imagine! We have to finish
[01:15.98]reading 300 pages before Monday!
[01:19.67]How can the professor expect us
[01:22.12]to do it in such a short time?
[01:24.52]M: Yeah, but what troubles me is that
[01:27.12]I can't find the book in the library
[01:29.34]or in the university bookstore.
[01:33.39]Q: What does the man mean?
[01:51.16]2. M: Do you think I could borrow your car
[01:54.85]to go grocery shopping?
[01:56.69]The supermarkets outside the city are so much cheaper.
[02:00.48]I'd also be happy to pick up anything you need.
[02:04.43]W: Well, I don't like to let anyone else drive my car.
[02:08.55]Tell you what, why don't we go together?
[02:12.61]Q: What does the woman mean?
[02:30.02]3. M: Forgive the mess in here.
[02:33.59]We had a party last night.
[02:35.46]There were a lot of people
[02:36.85]and they all brought food.
[02:38.66]W: Yeah, I can tell.
[02:40.34]Well, I guess it's pretty obvious
[02:42.85]what you'll be doing most of today.
[02:46.35]Q: What does the woman think the man will do?
[03:03.60]4. W: What time would suit you
[03:07.16]for the first-round talks with John Smith?
[03:10.47]M: Well, you know my schedule.
[03:12.75]Other than this Friday,
[03:14.17]one day is as good as the next.
[03:18.05]Q: What does the man mean?



[03:35.14]5. W: I was so angry yesterday!
[03:39.85]My biology teacher did not even let me explain
[03:43.48]why I missed the field trip.
[03:45.65]He just wouldn't let me pass!
[03:48.51]M: That doesn't seem fair.
[03:50.56]I'd feel that way too if I were you.
[03:54.24]Q: What does the man imply?
[04:11.90]6. M: I really can't stand the way
[04:16.31]David controls the conversation all the time.
[04:20.19]If he is going to be at your Christmas party,
[04:22.53]I just won't come.
[04:24.98]W: I'm sorry you feel that way,
[04:26.79]but my mother insists that he come.
[04:30.98]Q: What does the woman imply?
[04:49.05]7. W: You're taking a course with Prof. Johnson.
[04:54.63]What's your impression so far?
[04:56.78]M: Well, many students could hardly stay awake
[04:59.61]in his class without first drinking a cup of coffee.
[05:03.64]Q: What does the man imply?
[05:21.87]8. W: Have you ever put a computer together before?
[05:26.62]M: No, never. But I think if we follow these instructions exactly,
[05:31.72]we won't have much trouble.
[05:34.74]Q: What are the speakers going to do?


[05:52.64]Now you will hear the two long conversations.
[05:57.72]Conversation One
[05:59.72]W: What sort of hours do you work, Steve?
[06:02.43]M: Well, I have to work very long hours,
[06:05.68]about 11 hours a day.
[06:07.89]W: What time do you start?
[06:10.00]M: I work 9:00 to 3:00, then I start again at 5:30
[06:15.02]and work until 11:00, six days a week.
[06:18.29]So I have to work very unsocial hours.
[06:21.73]W: And do you have to work at the weekend?
[06:24.20]M: Oh, yes, that's our busiest time.
[06:27.31]I get Wednesdays off.
[06:29.78]W: What are the things you have to do
[06:31.72]and the things you don't have to do?
[06:34.06]M: Uh, I don't have to do the washing-up,
[06:36.74]so that's good. I have to wear white,
[06:39.62]and I have to keep everything in the kitchen totally clean.
[06:44.30]W: What's hard about the job?
[06:46.48]M: You are standing up all the time.
[06:48.99]When we are busy, people get angry and sharp,
[06:51.97]but that's normal.
[06:53.45]W: How did you learn the profession?



[06:55.89]M: Well, I did a two-year course at college.
[06:58.91]In the first year, we had to learn the basics,
[07:01.58]and then we had to take exams.
[07:03.87]W: Was it easy to find a job?
[07:06.87]M: I wrote to about six hotels
[07:09.25]and one of them gave me my first job,
[07:11.86]so I didn't have to wait too long.
[07:14.36]W: And what's the secret of being good at your job?
[07:18.69]M: Attention to detail.
[07:20.52]You have to love it.
[07:21.97]You have to show passion for it.
[07:24.29]W: And what are your plans for the future?
[07:27.48]M: I want to have my own place
[07:29.54]when the time is right.
[07:33.43]Questions 9 to 12 are based on
[07:35.98]the conversation you have just heard.
[07:41.03]9. What does the man say about his job?
[08:00.95]10. What does the man think
[08:03.54]is the hardest part of his job?
[08:21.48]11. Where did the man get his first job
[08:25.42]after graduation?
[08:43.05]12. What does the man say is important 
[08:46.72]to being good at his job?

[09:05.25]Conversation Two
[09:07.39]W: Now you've seen this table of figures
[09:09.72]about the pocket money children in Britain get?
[09:12.99]M: Yes. I thought it was quite interesting,
[09:16.05]but I don't quite understand the column entitled ¡°Change.¡±
[09:20.25]Can you explain what it means?
[09:22.45]W: Well, I think it means the change from the year before.
[09:27.39]I'm not a mathematician,
[09:28.92]but I assume the rise from 72p to 90p
[09:33.37]is a rise of 25%.
[09:36.06]M: Oh, yes, I see.
[09:37.74]And the inflation rate is there for comparison.
[09:41.29]W: Yes. Why do you think the rise in pocket money
[09:45.53]is often higher than inflation?
[09:48.66]M: I am sorry. I've no idea.
[09:51.30]Perhaps parents in Britain are too generous.
[09:54.46]W: Perhaps they are.
[09:56.27]But it looks as if children were a lot better off
[09:59.24]in 2001 than they were in 2002.
[10:03.18]That's strange, isn't it?


[10:05.81]And they seem to have been better off
[10:07.91]in 2003 than they are now.
[10:10.42]I wonder why that is.
[10:13.21]M: Yes, I don't understand that at all.
[10:16.54]W: Anyway, if you had children,
[10:18.62]how much pocket money would you give them?
[10:21.19]M: I don't know. I think I'll probably
[10:23.88]give them ¡ê2 a week.
[10:26.47]W: Would you? And what would you
[10:28.50]expect them to do with it?
[10:30.37]M: Well, out of that,
[10:31.71]they have to buy some small personal things,
[10:34.26]but I wouldn't expect them to
[10:36.04]save to buy their own socks, for example.
[10:38.79]W: Yes, by the way, do most children
[10:42.08]in your country get pocket money?
[10:44.33]M: Yeah, they do.





[10:47.87]Questions 13 to 15 are based on
[10:50.73]the conversation you have just heard.
[10:56.08]13. What is the table of figures about?
[11:16.84]14. What do we learn from the conversation
[11:21.66]about British children's pocket money?
[11:39.97]15. Supposing the man had children,
[11:44.56]what would he expect them to do with their pocket money?
[12:03.86]Section B
[12:05.41]Directions: In this section, 
[12:08.19]you will hear 3 short passages.
[12:11.59]At the end of each passage, 
[12:13.61]you will hear some questions.
[12:15.95]Both the passage and the questions 
[12:17.59]will be spoken only once.
[12:20.79]After you hear a question,
[12:22.29]you must choose the best answer from
[12:24.93]the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[12:29.82]Then mark the corresponding letter
[12:32.09]on Answer Sheet 1 with a single line through the centre.

[12:37.32]Passage One
[12:39.42]As the new sales director for a national computer firm,
[12:43.34]Alex Gordon was looking forward to his first meeting
[12:46.50]with the company's district managers. 
[12:49.13]Everyone arrived on time,
[12:51.00]and Alex's presentation went extremely well.
[12:54.44]He decided to end the meeting with the conversation
[12:57.50]about the importance of the district managers 
[12:59.75]to the company's plans.
[13:02.10]¡°I believe we are going to continue
[13:04.21]to increase our share of the market,¡± he began,
[13:08.46]¡°because of the quality of the people in this room.
[13:12.46]The district manager is the key to
[13:14.35]the success of the sales representatives in his district.
[13:18.59]He sets the term for everyone else.
[13:21.52]If he has ambitious goals
[13:23.31]and is willing to put in long hours,
[13:26.32]everyone in his unit will follow his example.¡±
[13:30.87]When Alex was finished,
[13:32.39]he received polite applause,
[13:35.17]but hardly the warm response he had hoped for.
[13:38.74]Later, he spoke with one of the senior managers.





[13:42.63]¡°Things were going so well until the end,¡±
[13:45.75]Alex said disappointedly,
[13:48.00]¡°Obviously, I said the wrong thing.¡±
[13:50.60]¡°Yes,¡± the district manager replied,
[13:53.61]¡°half of our managers are women.
[13:56.29]Most have worked their way up from sales representatives,
[13:59.58]and they are very proud of the role
[14:01.78]they played in the company's growth.
[14:04.42]They don't care at all about political correctness.
[14:07.83]But they were definitely surprised and distressed
[14:11.08]to be referred to as 'he' in your speech.¡±
[14:16.92]Questions 16 to 19 are based on
[14:19.21]the passage you have just heard.
[14:24.03]16. Who did Alex Gordon speak to
[14:29.01]at the first meeting?

[14:45.82]17. What did Alex want to emphasize
[14:51.03]at the end of his presentation?
[15:09.09]18. What do we learn about the audience
[15:13.57]at the meeting?
[15:30.24]19. Why did Alex fail to receive
[15:34.99]the warm response he had hoped for?


[15:53.23]Passage Two
[15:55.01]The way to complain is to
[15:56.48]act business like and important.
[15:59.90]If your complaint is immediate,
[16:02.09]suppose you got the wrong order at a restaurant,
[16:04.99]make a polite but firm request to see the manager.
[16:08.81]When the manager comes, ask his or her name.
[16:11.96]And then state your problem
[16:13.45]and what you expect to have done about it.
[16:16.47]Be polite! Shouting or acting rude will get you nowhere.
[16:21.71]But also be firm in making your complaint.
[16:25.64]Besides, act important. 
[16:28.21]This doesn't mean to put on airs
[16:30.33]and say "do you know who I am?"
[16:33.32]What it means is that
[16:34.50]people are often treated the way
[16:36.36]they expect to be treated.


[16:38.88]If you act like someone
[16:40.22]who expects a fair request to be granted,
[16:43.03]chances are it will be granted.
[16:45.25]The worst way to complain is over the telephone.
[16:50.35]You are speaking to a voice
[16:51.67]coming from someone you cannot see.
[16:54.26]So you can't tell how the person on the line is reacting.
[16:58.15]It is easy for that person to give you the runaround.
[17:02.26]Complaining in person or by letter
[17:04.47]is generally more effective.
[17:07.24]If your complaint does not require
[17:09.28]an immediate response,
[17:10.78]it often helps to complain by letter.
[17:13.62]If you have an appliance that doesn't work,
[17:16.52]send a letter to the store that sold it.
[17:19.47]Be businesslike and stick to the point.
[17:23.04]Don't spend a paragraph on
[17:24.79]how your uncle Joe tried to
[17:26.43]fix the problem and couldn't.
[17:31.31]Questions 20 to 22 are based on
[17:34.21]the passage you have just heard.
[17:39.37]20. What does the speaker suggest you do
[17:44.12]when you are not served properly at a restaurant?
[18:02.94]21. Why does the speaker say the worst way
[18:07.57]to complain is over the telephone?
[18:26.18]22. What should you do
[18:29.91]if you make a complaint by letter?
[18:48.32]Passage Three
[18:50.56]Barbara Sanders is a wife
[18:52.31]and the mother of two children, ages two and four.
[18:56.32]Her husband, Tom, is an engineer
[18:58.68]and makes an excellent salary.
[19:00.78]Before Barbara had children,
[19:02.46]she worked as an architect for the government,
[19:05.30]designing government housing.
[19:07.67]She quit her job when she became pregnant,
[19:10.54]but is now interested in returning to work.
[19:13.73]She's been offered an excellent job
[19:15.75]with the government.
[19:17.62]Her husband feels it's unnecessary for her to work
[19:21.06]since the family does not need the added income.
[19:24.42]He also thinks that a woman should
[19:26.06]stay home with her children.
[19:28.65]If Barbara feels the need to do socially important work,
[19:32.20]he thinks that she should do volunteer work
[19:35.08]one or two days a week.
[19:37.38]Barbara, on the other hand,
[19:39.02]has missed the excitement of her profession
[19:41.66]and does not feel she would be satisfied
[19:44.25]doing volunteer work.






[19:46.43]She would also like to have her own income,
[19:49.18]so she does not have to ask her husband for money
[19:52.61]whenever she wants to buy something.
[19:55.03]She does not think it's necessary to stay home
[19:58.06]every day with the children
[20:00.00]and she knows a very reliable baby-sitter
[20:02.87]who's willing to come to her house.
[20:05.36]Tom does not think a baby-sitter can replace a mother
[20:08.85]and thinks it's a bad idea for the children
[20:11.48]to spend so much time with someone
[20:14.13]who's not part of the family.
[20:18.90]Questions 23 to 25 are based on
[20:22.13]the passage you have just heard.
[20:26.89]23. What was Barbara's profession
[20:31.54]before she had children?
[20:49.11]24. What does Barbara's husband suggest she do
[20:54.28]if she wants to work?
[21:11.07]25. What does Tom think about hiring a baby-sitter?
[21:33.36]Section C
[21:35.12]Directions: In this section,
[21:37.64]you will hear a passage three times.
[21:41.06]When the passage is read for the first time,
[21:43.65]you should listen carefully for its general idea.
[21:47.57]When the passage is read for the second time,
[21:50.39]you are required to fill in the blanks
[21:52.95]with the exact words
[21:54.83]you have just heard.
[21:56.76]Finally, when the passage is read for the third time,
[22:00.53]you should check what you have written.
[22:03.21]Now listen to the passage.


[22:06.52]Almost every child,
[22:08.00]on the first day he sets foot
[22:09.74]in a school building, is smarter, more curious,
[22:13.43]less afraid of what he doesn't know,
[22:15.92]better at finding and figuring things out,
[22:18.92]more confident, resourceful, persistent and independent
[22:23.37]than he will ever be again in his schooling¡ª
[22:26.32]or, unless he is very unusual and very lucky,
[22:29.91]for the rest of his life.
[22:32.20]Already, by paying close attention to
[22:34.54]and interacting with the world
[22:35.95]and people around him,
[22:37.56]and without any school-type formal instruction,
[22:40.73]he has done a task far more difficult,
[22:43.74]complicated and abstract than anything
[22:46.72]he will be asked to do in school,
[22:49.07]or than any of his teachers has done for years.
[22:52.62]He has solved the mystery of language.
[22:56.05]He has discovered it¡ª
[22:57.78]babies don't even know that language exists¡ª
[23:00.79]and he has found out how it works
[23:03.67]and learnt to use it appropriately.
[23:06.60]He has done it by exploring, by experimenting,
[23:10.26]by developing his own model of the grammar of language,
[23:13.89]by trying it out and seeing whether it works,
[23:17.10]by gradually changing it and refining it
[23:20.47]until it does work.
[23:22.30]And while he has been doing this,
[23:24.50]he has been learning other things as well,
[23:27.26]including many of the concepts
[23:29.32]that the schools think only they can teach him,
[23:33.01]and many that are more complicated than the ones
[23:35.91]they do try to teach him.
[23:40.41]Now the passage will be read again.
[23:44.40]Almost every child,
[23:45.83]on the first day he sets foot
[23:47.77]in a school building, is smarter, more curious,
[23:51.25]less afraid of what he doesn't know,
[23:53.53]better at finding and figuring things out,
[23:56.58]more confident, resourceful, persistent and independent
[24:01.03]than he will ever be again in his schooling¡ª
[24:04.01]or, unless he is very unusual and very lucky,
[24:07.67]for the rest of his life.
[24:09.97]Already, by paying close attention to
[24:12.10]and interacting with the world
[24:13.97]and people around him,
[24:15.39]and without any school-type formal instruction,
[24:18.59]he has done a task far more difficult,
[24:21.48]complicated and abstract than anything
[24:24.72]he will be asked to do in school,
[24:26.75]or than any of his teachers has done for years.
[24:30.33]He has solved the mystery of language.
[24:33.87]He has discovered it¡ª
[24:35.39]babies don't even know that language exists¡ª
[24:38.44]and he has found out how it works
[24:41.62]and learnt to use it appropriately.
[24:44.23]He has done it by exploring, by experimenting,
[24:47.89]by developing his own model of the grammar of language,
[24:51.67]by trying it out and seeing whether it works,
[24:54.99]by gradually changing it and refining it
[24:58.17]until it does work.
[24:59.70]And while he has been doing this,
[25:02.16]he has been learning other things as well,
[25:04.96]including many of the concepts
[25:07.05]that the schools think only they can teach him,
[25:10.49]and many that are more complicated than the ones
[25:13.50]they do try to teach him.
[25:18.07]Now the passage will be read for the third time.
[25:22.54]Almost every child,
[25:23.90]on the first day he sets foot
[25:25.75]in a school building, is smarter, more curious,
[25:29.54]less afraid of what he doesn't know,
[25:31.77]better at finding and figuring things out,
[25:34.61]more confident, resourceful, persistent and independent
[25:39.08]than he will ever be again in his schooling¡ª
[25:42.32]or£¬unless he is very unusual and very lucky,
[25:45.72]for the rest of his life.
[25:48.07]Already, by paying close attention to
[25:50.40]and interacting with the world
[25:52.01]and people around him,
[25:53.34]and without any school-type formal instruction,
[25:56.49]he has done a task far more difficult,
[25:59.54]complicated and abstract than anything
[26:02.58]he will be asked to do in school,
[26:04.78]or than any of his teachers has done for years.
[26:08.71]He has solved the mystery of language.
[26:11.62]He has discovered it¡ª
[26:13.42]babies don't even know that language exists¡ª
[26:16.49]and he has found out how it works
[26:19.66]and learnt to use it appropriately.
[26:22.28]He has done it by exploring, by experimenting,
[26:25.76]by developing his own model of the grammar of language,
[26:29.59]by trying it out and seeing whether it works,
[26:33.06]by gradually changing it and refining it
[26:36.25]until it does work.
[26:37.88]And while he has been doing this,
[26:40.29]he has been learning other things as well,
[26:42.92]including many of the concepts
[26:45.09]that the schools think only they can teach him,
[26:48.60]and many that are more complicated than the ones
[26:51.61]they do try to teach him.
[26:56.54]This is the end of listening comprehension.
