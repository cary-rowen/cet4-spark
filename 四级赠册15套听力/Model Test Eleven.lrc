[00:15.85]Model Test Eleven
[00:18.88]Section A
[00:20.54]Directions:
[00:22.04]In this section,
[00:23.17]you will hear 8 short conversations
[00:25.88]and 2 long conversations.
[00:29.37]At the end of each conversation,
[00:31.61]one or more questions will be asked about what was said.
[00:35.59]Both the conversation and the questions
[00:38.56]will be spoken only once.
[00:42.10]After each question there will be a pause.
[00:45.46]During the pause,
[00:46.46]you must read the four choices marked A), B), C) and D),
[00:52.22]and decide which is the best answer.
[00:55.56]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:59.62]with a single line through the centre.
[01:02.48]Now let¡¯s begin with the eight short conversations.
[01:09.24]1. M: As you can see from the drawings,
[01:13.56]the kitchen has one door into the dining room,
[01:16.69]another into the family room and a third to the outside.
[01:22.59]W: The door into the family room isn¡¯t big enough.
[01:25.91]Could it be made wider?
[01:29.06]Q: What are the speakers doing?
[01:46.85]2. M: I¡¯m thinking about where to go for a bite tonight.
[01:52.43]Any suggestions, Barbara?
[01:54.60]W: Well, how about the French restaurant near the KFC?
[01:59.13]Frankly, I¡¯ve had enough of our canteen food.
[02:04.08]Q: What do we learn about the woman?
[02:22.00]3. W: Hey, if you can¡¯t enjoy the music
[02:28.11]at a sensible volume,
[02:29.80]why not use earphones?
[02:32.04]I¡¯m preparing for the speech contest.
[02:34.81]M: Oh, sorry.
[02:36.62]I didn¡¯t realize I¡¯ve been bothering you all this time.
[02:41.75]Q: What is the man probably doing?
[02:59.93]4. M: Finally, I¡¯ve got the chance
[03:03.56]to put on my new suit tonight.
[03:06.24]I hope to make a good impression on your family.
[03:09.93]W: Come on! It¡¯s only a family reunion.
[03:12.92]So jeans and T-shirts are just fine.
[03:17.34]Q: What does the woman mean?
[03:34.69]5. M: Would you like to see
[03:38.30]those pants in brown and navy blue?
[03:41.17]These two colors are coming in this season.
[03:44.53]W: Oh, actually grey is my favorite color,
[03:48.64]but I prefer something made from cotton,
[03:52.01]100% cotton, I mean.
[03:56.14]Q: What is the woman looking for?
[04:13.72]6. W: From here,
[04:16.91]the mountains look as if you could
[04:19.36]just reach out and touch them.
[04:21.90]M: That¡¯s why I chose this lodge.
[04:24.74]It has one of the best views in Switzerland.
[04:29.37]Q: What is the man¡¯s chief consideration
[04:32.05]in choosing the lodge?
[04:49.94]7. M: What do I have to do to apply for a passport?
[04:55.46]W: You need proof of citizenship,
[04:58.07]either an old passport or a birth certificate,
[05:01.40]and three photographs.
[05:03.67]Then you must complete this form and pay a fee.
[05:08.00]Q: What is the man most probably going to do?
[05:27.44]8. M: Miss, can I interest you in a pork special
[05:32.71]we're serving tonight?
[05:34.54]It¡¯s only $7.99, half the usual price and it¡¯s very tasty.
[05:41.92]W: Oh really? I will try it.
[05:46.72]Q: What does the man say about the dish?
[06:04.89]Now you will hear the two long conversations.
[06:10.67]Conversation One
[06:12.76]W£ºGood evening, and welcome to this week¡¯s Business World,
[06:17.27]the program for and about business people.
[06:20.36]Tonight, we have Mr. Steven Kayne,
[06:23.51]who has just taken over an established bicycle shop.
[06:27.93]Tell us, Mr. Kayne, what made you want to run your own store?
[06:33.42]M: Well, I've always loved racing bikes and fixing them.
[06:37.60]When I was working full-time as a salesman for a big company,
[06:42.39]I seldom had time to enjoy my hobby.
[06:46.24]I knew then that as soon as I had enough money
[06:49.14]to get my own business going,
[06:51.10]I¡¯d do it.
[06:52.78]I had my heart set on it
[06:54.78]and I didn¡¯t let anything stand in my way.
[06:58.18]When I went down to the bank and got a business loan,
[07:01.93]I knew I¡¯d love being my own boss.
[07:05.55]Now my time is my own.
[07:08.32]I open the store when I want and leave when I want.
[07:13.27]W: You mean you don¡¯t keep regular hours?
[07:16.42]M: Well, the sign on my store says the hours are ten to six,
[07:21.10]but if business is slower than usual,
[07:23.98]I can just lock up and take off early.
[07:28.16]W: Have you hired any employees to work with you yet?
[07:31.99]M: Yeah, a couple of friends of mine
[07:34.59]who love biking as much as I do.
[07:37.23]They help me out a few days a week.
[07:40.48]It¡¯s great because we play cards or just sit around
[07:44.32]and talk when there are no customers.
[07:46.81]W: Thank you, Mr. Kayne.
[07:49.00]We wish you success in your new business.
[07:54.04]Questions 9 to 12 are based on the conversation
[07:58.42]you have just heard.
[08:02.64]9. What is the woman doing?
[08:22.18]10. What did Mr. Kayne do
[08:26.22]before he took over the bicycle shop?
[08:44.54]11. Why did the man take over a bicycle shop?
[09:05.84]12. What do we learn about the people working in the shop?
[09:28.28]Conversation Two
[09:30.66]W: Well, the main activities in the region
[09:33.82]were historically steel and paper processing, I think.
[09:38.14]M: Yes, but I¡¯m not quite sure about
[09:40.72]the status of those industries now.
[09:43.44]Could you tell us something about that?
[09:45.84]W: Yes, of course.
[09:47.33]In fact, they are less significant,
[09:49.90]but steel-related manufacturing still accounts for
[09:53.60]44% of industrial activity,
[09:56.82]so it¡¯s still very important.
[09:58.85]In fact, 80% of Spain¡¯s machine tools are
[10:03.26]from the Basque Country.
[10:05.56]As for paper processing,
[10:07.48]there¡¯s still a little.
[10:09.14]But it¡¯s no longer what it once was in the region.
[10:12.46]So, is that clear?
[10:14.23]M: Yes, thanks.
[10:16.11]W: Now, to get back to what I was saying,
[10:18.64]there¡¯s a lot of unemployment
[10:20.52]as well as geographical problems in the region.
[10:24.58]M: Sorry, Victoria.
[10:26.48]What do you mean by geographical problems?
[10:30.06]W: Well, what I mean is the area
[10:32.84]is very hilly, mountainous in parts,
[10:35.98]so there used to be transport problems. 
[10:38.53]Now though there are new train links and better roads.
[10:42.09]But it may be that some smaller towns inland
[10:45.23]remain not very well connected. Is that OK?
[10:48.84]Does that make sense?
[10:50.91]When we talk about specific location suggestions
[10:53.85]for the factory,
[10:55.30]we¡¯ll see this in more detail,
[10:57.64]so we¡¯ll come back to this question, OK?
[11:00.78]M: OK, right.
[11:02.70]W: So I was about to say something
[11:05.41]about the work force in the region
[11:07.81]and the level of training and education.
[11:10.36]In general, it¡¯s very good and improving.
[11:15.51]Questions 13 to 15 are based on the conversation
[11:19.34]you have just heard.
[11:23.58]13. What does the woman say about
[11:27.78]steel-related manufacturing in the region?
[11:46.71]14. What problem hinders the region¡¯s development?
[12:07.69]15. What will the speakers discuss later?
[12:28.76]Section B
[12:30.58]Directions:
[12:31.92]In this section,
[12:33.24]you will hear 3 short passages.
[12:36.47]At the end of each passage,
[12:38.59]you will hear some questions.
[12:40.78]Both the passage and the questions
[12:42.58]will be spoken only once.
[12:45.43]After you hear a question,
[12:47.15]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[12:50.91]marked A), B), C) and D).
[12:54.65]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[12:58.55]with a single line through the centre.
[13:04.45]Passage One
[13:06.38]I first met Joe Ganz when we were both nine years old,
[13:11.32]which is probably the only reason
[13:13.49]he¡¯s one of my best friends.
[13:15.94]If I had first met Joe as a freshman in high school,
[13:20.17]we wouldn¡¯t even have had the chance
[13:22.36]to get to know each other.
[13:24.32]Joe is a day student,
[13:26.44]but I am a boarding student.
[13:29.11]We haven¡¯t been in the same classes,
[13:31.81]sports or extracurricular activities.
[13:35.15]Nonetheless, I spend nearly every weekend at his house
[13:39.77]and we talk on the phone every night.
[13:43.51]This is not to say that we would not have been compatible
[13:47.28]if we had first met in our freshman year.
[13:50.71]Rather, we would not have been likely to spend enough time
[13:54.95]getting to know each other
[13:56.72]due to the lack of immediately visible mutual interests.
[14:00.89]In fact, to be honest,
[14:03.28]I struggle even now to think of things we have in common.
[14:07.90]But maybe that¡¯s
[14:09.14]what makes us enjoy each other¡¯s company so much.
[14:12.99]When I look at my friendship with Joe,
[14:16.34]I wonder how many people I¡¯ve known whom I never disliked
[14:20.71]but simply didn¡¯t take the time to get to know.
[14:25.19]Thanks to Joe,
[14:26.55]I have realized how little basis there is,
[14:29.70]for the social divisions
[14:31.40]that exist in every community.
[14:34.63]Since this realization,
[14:36.16]I have begun to make an even more determined effort to
[14:40.50]find friends in unexpected people and places.
[14:46.95]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage
[14:50.79]you have just heard.
[14:54.76]16. Why does the speaker say Joe Ganz
[14:59.88]became one of his best friends?
[15:18.74]17. Where does the speaker spend most of his weekends?
[15:41.20]18. What has the speaker learned
[15:45.15]from his friendship with Joe?
[16:03.22]Passage Two
[16:05.48]It was a bad night for Lewis.
[16:08.32]His research in the neighboring town
[16:10.99]had taken longer than he expected.
[16:13.91]It was late and he was very tired when he drove home.
[16:17.97]He turned into his building¡¯s parking lot,
[16:20.34]but all the spaces were full.
[16:23.09]He drove back out onto the street
[16:25.65]looking for a parking space.
[16:28.31]The first block was full.
[16:30.52]The next block was almost empty.
[16:33.49]Lewis didn¡¯t see a ¡°No Parking¡± sign,
[16:36.35]but he suspected that
[16:37.61]if parking were allowed there,
[16:39.68]most of the spaces would be filled.
[16:42.53]Then he saw a small parking lot with two free spaces.
[16:47.37]He was so glad to see them
[16:48.91]that he didn¡¯t even think to read the sign by the entrance.
[16:54.38]He drove in, parked, and hurried home to go to bed.
[16:59.75]The next morning he went back to the lot to get his car.
[17:03.86]It was gone.
[17:06.21]He ran home and telephoned the city police to say
[17:09.72]that his car had been stolen.
[17:12.27]It took the police only a minute to tell him
[17:15.00]what had happened.
[17:16.58]His car had been on a private lot.
[17:19.28]It had been taken away by the police.
[17:22.42]Lewis had to take a taxi to the city garage far
[17:26.15]from the center of town.
[17:28.10]He had to pay a fee of $40 to get his car back.
[17:32.31]In addition, he got a parking ticket,
[17:35.16]his first one ever in Greenville.
[17:40.92]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage
[17:44.71]you have just heard.
[17:48.93]19. Where did Lewis intend to park his car
[17:53.97]when he came back from work one night?
[18:12.37]20. What did Lewis think had happened
[18:16.13]to his car the next morning?
[18:34.08]21. Where did Lewis finally get his car back?
[18:55.73]Passage Three
[18:57.98]Well, to pick up where we left off last time,
[19:01.66]I believe we agreed that creativity is a mysterious idea.
[19:06.83]It¡¯s one of those things we all recognize when we see it.
[19:11.10]But we don¡¯t really understand what it is.
[19:15.20]We seem to feel that some people are naturally creative,
[19:19.49]but we don¡¯t know how they got that way.
[19:22.87]Is creativity a natural gift like good looks?
[19:26.82]Or is it something that can be acquired like knowledge?
[19:31.73]Perhaps if we analyze the creative process carefully,
[19:35.56]we might get some insight into what it is
[19:38.65]and how it might work in our lives.
[19:41.87]The creative process has always been accepted
[19:45.04]as the source of all important work in the arts.
[19:48.71]But we should not think the creativity
[19:51.54]plays a role only in the arts.
[19:54.54]Every major scientific discovery began with
[19:57.60]someone imagining the world to look differently
[20:01.06]from the way others saw it.
[20:03.56]And this is what the creativity is all about¡ª
[20:07.37]imagining the world in a new way.
[20:09.76]And despite what you may believe about
[20:12.45]the limits of your own creative imaginations,
[20:15.79]we all have the potential to imagine the world
[20:19.28]in an absolutely new way.
[20:22.24]In fact, you were born with it.
[20:25.39]It is your birth right as a human being.
[20:28.38]And what¡¯s more, you use it every day
[20:31.96]almost every moment of your life.
[20:35.20]Your creative imagination is what you use
[20:38.66]to make sense of your experiences.
[20:41.72]It¡¯s your creative mind that gets meaning
[20:44.63]from chaos of your experiences
[20:47.12]and brings order to your world.
[20:52.29]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage
[20:56.36]you have just heard.
[21:00.24]22. What did the speaker most probably discuss last time?
[21:22.92]23. What is a widely accepted idea
[21:27.79]about the creative process?
[21:46.00]24. What leads to major scientific discoveries
[21:51.86]according to the speaker?
[22:09.64]25. What does the speaker imply about the creative process?
[22:32.61]Section C
[22:34.39]Directions:
[22:35.80]In this section,
[22:37.34]you will hear a passage three times.
[22:40.19]When the passage is read for the first time,
[22:42.85]you should listen carefully for its general idea.
[22:46.82]When the passage is read for the second time,
[22:49.79]you are required to fill in the blanks
[22:52.32]with the exact words you have just heard.
[22:55.68]Finally, when the passage is read for the third time,
[22:59.62]you should check what you have written.
[23:02.45]Now listen to the passage.
[23:06.29]Students have been complaining more and more
[23:09.23]about stolen property.
[23:11.80]Radios, cell phones, bicycles, pocket calculators,
[23:16.01]and books have all been reported stolen.
[23:19.84]Are there enough campus police to do the job?
[23:23.46]There are 20 officers in the Campus Security Division.
[23:27.65]Their job is to handle crime, accidents,
[23:31.34]lost and found items and traffic problems on campus.
[23:35.96]More than half of their time is spent directing traffic
[23:39.66]and writing parking tickets.
[23:42.15]Responding promptly to accidents
[23:44.32]and other emergencies is important,
[23:47.13]but it is their smallest job.
[23:50.15]Dealing with crime takes up the rest of their time.
[23:54.06]Very rarely do any violent crimes actually occur.
[23:59.23]In the last five years,
[24:00.92]there have been no murders,
[24:02.82]seven robberies and about 60 other violent attacks,
[24:07.90]most of these involving fights at parties.
[24:11.20]On the other hand,
[24:12.95]there have been hundreds of thefts
[24:15.03]and cases of deliberate damaging of public property,
[24:18.65]which usually involves breaking windows or lights,
[24:22.63]or writing on walls.
[24:25.12]The thefts are not the carefully planned burglaries
[24:28.00]that you see in movies.
[24:30.48]Things get stolen
[24:31.86]when it¡¯s easy to steal them
[24:34.27]because they are left lying around unwatched.
[24:38.16]Do we really need more police?
[24:41.08]Hiring more campus police would cost money,
[24:44.41]possibly making our tuition go up again.
[24:48.24]A better way to solve this problem might be for all of us
[24:52.75]to be more careful with our things.
[24:57.86]Now the passage will be read again.
[25:02.18]Students have been complaining more and more
[25:05.12]about stolen property.
[25:07.72]Radios, cell phones, bicycles, pocket calculators,
[25:11.77]and books have all been reported stolen.

[25:31.85]More than half of their time is spent directing traffic
[25:35.68]and writing parking tickets.
[25:37.93]Responding promptly to accidents

[26:03.82]most of these involving fights at parties.
[26:06.99]On the other hand,
[26:08.66]there have been hundreds of thefts
[26:10.95]and cases of deliberate damaging of public property,
[26:14.50]which usually involves breaking windows or lights,
[26:18.68]or writing on walls.
[26:20.60]The thefts are not the carefully planned burglaries
[26:23.87]that you see in movies.
[26:26.07]Things get stolen
[26:27.60]when it¡¯s easy to steal them
[26:30.10]because they are left lying around unwatched.
[26:34.02]Do we really need more police?
[26:36.75]Hiring more campus police would cost money,
[26:40.64]possibly making our tuition go up again.
[26:44.13]A better way to solve this problem might be for all of us
[26:48.54]to be more careful with our things.
[26:53.21]Now the passage will be read for the third time.
[26:58.33]Students have been complaining more and more
[27:01.29]about stolen property.
