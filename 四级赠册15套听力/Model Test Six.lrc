[00:15.90]Model Test Six
[00:19.02]Section A
[00:20.62]Directions: In this section,
[00:23.74]you will hear 8 short conversations
[00:26.42]and 2 long conversations.
[00:29.46]At the end of each conversation,
[00:32.09]one or more questions will be asked
[00:34.45]about what was said.
[00:36.26]Both the conversation and the questions
[00:39.02]will be spoken only once.
[00:41.72]After each question there will be a pause.
[00:44.97]During the pause,
[00:46.66]you must read the four choices
[00:49.24]marked A), B), C) and D),
[00:52.92]and decide which is the best answer.
[00:56.37]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[01:00.76]with a single line through the centre.
[01:04.50]Now let¡¯s begin with the eight short conversations.
[01:10.06]1. W: I am a bit fed up with catching the same train
[01:15.12]every morning,
[01:16.74]sitting in the same office all day,
[01:19.48]and watching the same television programs.
[01:22.81]M: Well, our great-great-grandfathers
[01:26.14]had more fun, didn¡¯t they?
[01:28.59]They hunted for their food and
[01:31.16]grew their own vegetables and did things for themselves.
[01:36.25]Q: What does the man mean?
[01:54.55]2. M: Why hasn¡¯t the bus come yet?
[01:58.82]We have been waiting here for a while.
[02:01.76]What time does the bus leave for the airport?
[02:05.35]W: I don¡¯t know.
[02:06.70]It used to leave every half an hour,
[02:09.62]but I think the schedule¡¯s been changed.
[02:13.13]Q: What do we learn from the conversation?
[02:33.07]3. W: Well, I¡¯ve been with the company
[02:36.61]for seven years and I¡¯ve never been promoted.
[02:40.58]The salary I¡¯m earning can hardly cover my expenses.
[02:45.44]M: I understand,
[02:47.26]but promotions are based on achievement,
[02:50.07]not on length of employment.
[02:52.62]How about this?
[02:54.22]This year you will get more bonuses.
[02:57.89]Q: What do we learn about the woman?
[03:15.61]4. W: I think I should have a look at the bulletin boards
[03:20.20]on campus to see if anyone¡¯s got an apartment.
[03:24.02]M: And if that doesn¡¯t turn up anything,
[03:26.83]you can check out the ads in the college
[03:29.63]and local newspapers.
[03:32.26]Q: What does the man suggest the woman do?
[03:50.82]5. M: Here¡¯s your lease. Please sign here.
[03:55.97]We¡¯ll sign one copy and give it to you.
[03:59.25]W: Perhaps you could give me a few minutes
[04:01.91]to read the lease, sir.
[04:03.89]I¡¯ve never seen a lease before,
[04:06.46]so I think I should understand its terms before I sign it.
[04:11.29]Q: What does the woman want to do?
[04:29.13]6. W: Your birthday is coming around.
[04:32.64]Do you have any plan for the celebration?
[04:35.80]Do you have a particular restaurant in mind?
[04:39.05]M: I¡¯ve been to the western restaurant in the past three years.
[04:43.80]I¡¯m thinking about eating in a Chinese restaurant
[04:47.26]for a change this time.
[04:49.80]Q: What does the man imply?
[05:07.62]7. M: Don¡¯t tell me you went to the shopping center again!
[05:13.16]You idle your time in stupid manners.
[05:16.87]Tiring yourself out by high volume of bargaining and high heels.
[05:21.87]W: To begin with, a satisfactory deal includes
[05:26.07]a careful examination and a technical bargain.
[05:29.67]And I feel fulfilled from that.
[05:32.79]Q: What are the speakers talking about?
[05:51.07]8. W: I¡¯ve heard that you are going to move.
[05:55.00]How about the new house?
[05:57.54]M: Oh, it¡¯s perfect.
[05:59.49]It¡¯s everything that we¡¯ve been looking for¡ª
[06:02.26]the neighbors are nice,
[06:03.81]and I love that huge yard and the fireplace in the bedroom.
[06:08.65]Q: What does the man think about the new house?
[06:28.50]Now you'll hear the two long conversations.
[06:34.37]Conversation One
[06:36.51]W: What did you do at the office today?
[06:39.06]M: I had a really busy day.
[06:41.77]I had to work a little overtime.
[06:44.47]In the morning,
[06:45.55]an important client called to place a large order.
[06:49.18]I had to check some things with my colleagues
[06:52.33]before confirming the order.
[06:54.83]W: What kind of things did you need to check?
[06:57.75]M: The most important thing was to check
[07:00.27]whether we had the goods in stock.
[07:02.95]If the goods are in stock,
[07:05.22]we can deliver them immediately.
[07:07.97]I also had to check the price.
[07:11.07]This customer is very important,
[07:13.62]so he gets special prices.
[07:16.47]W: I see.
[07:17.40]Did anything else happen?
[07:19.71]M: I received a lot of emails from potential clients
[07:23.77]that I had to answer.
[07:25.67]Each time, I had to check files to see
[07:29.19]what we had agreed at earlier meetings.
[07:32.39]Each client had different conditions and requirements.
[07:37.01]W: It must be difficult to remember the details
[07:40.48]for each individual client.
[07:43.22]M: Yes. That¡¯s why I have everything on computer files.
[07:48.31]I don¡¯t use much paper at our office.
[07:51.54]After lunch, I had to deal with a complaint from a client.
[07:58.34]W: I hate dealing with complaints.
[08:00.82]Was it a reasonable complaint?
[08:03.35]M: Yes, it was.
[08:05.33]I managed to sort out the problem,
[08:08.32]but I was tied up with the matter for over an hour.
[08:12.00]W: You certainly had a busy day.
[08:14.89]M: That¡¯s not all! I also had to finish writing
[08:18.83]a sales report for my boss.
[08:21.05]In the end, I finished everything.
[08:24.19]I wonder what will be waiting for me tomorrow morning.
[08:30.88]Questions 9 to 11 are based on the conversation
[08:34.55]you have just heard.
[08:38.71]9. What does the man think is the most important thing to check?
[09:00.02]10. Why does the man have everything on computer files?
[09:21.17]11. What was the last thing the man did?
[09:41.65]Conversation Two
[09:43.28]M: Hi, Melissa! How are you doing?
[09:47.21]W:  I¡¯m so stressed! I don¡¯t know where to go to school
[09:50.93]and what to major in!
[09:52.80]M: Don¡¯t worry.
[09:54.11]You have plenty of time to decide.
[09:56.60]W: Actually, I don¡¯t.
[09:58.15]If I want to get grants and scholarships
[10:00.90]to help me pay for tuition,
[10:03.23]then I need to apply by Monday.
[10:05.85]M: Oh, I see.
[10:07.56]Well, let me see if I can help you.
[10:10.49]Which subject do you like best?
[10:13.33]W: I guess I¡¯d have to say English.
[10:15.78]I usually do pretty well in English class.
[10:19.55]M: Which subject do you get your highest grades in?
[10:23.52]W: Actually, that would have to be math.
[10:26.80]M: OK.
[10:27.94]Well, what kind of job do you want
[10:30.40]to get when you graduate?
[10:32.49]W: I don¡¯t know.
[10:34.02]All I know is that I want
[10:36.41]to make lots of money! In a perfect world,
[10:39.46]I would enjoy my work,
[10:41.62]not have to do much,
[10:43.56]and make lots of money!
[10:45.83]M: OK. Stop dreaming.
[10:48.16]Since you sound a bit unsure,
[10:50.72]I¡¯d suggest taking math and English classes
[10:54.36]in your first semester to see which one you enjoy more.
[10:59.32]You can always change your mind.
[11:01.72]W: That¡¯s a good idea.
[11:04.13]But what about deciding on where to go to college?
[11:08.06]M: Why don¡¯t we go take a tour to some
[11:10.98]of the universities around here this weekend?
[11:14.52]W: That sounds like a great idea,
[11:16.67]but to be honest,
[11:18.20]I¡¯ve already decided not to go to school near home.
[11:22.02]I need to broaden my horizons.
[11:25.07]That¡¯s what you always say,
[11:27.15]right?
[11:28.04]M: Yes.
[11:32.64]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation
[11:37.51]you have just heard.
[11:41.84]12. Why does the woman have to decide her school
[11:46.52]and major by Monday?
[12:04.45]13. What is the woman¡¯s dream job like?
[12:25.03]14. What does the man suggest the woman do?
[12:45.55]15. Why does the woman want to go to college
[12:49.85]far away from home?
[13:08.49]Section B
[13:09.65]Directions: In this section,
[13:12.17]you will hear 3 short passages.
[13:15.22]At the end of each passage,
[13:17.02]you will hear some questions.
[13:18.95]Both the passage and the questions
[13:21.24]will be spoken only once.
[13:23.53]After you hear a question,
[13:25.71]you must choose the best answer
[13:27.56]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[13:32.67]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[13:36.69]with a single line through the centre.
[13:40.25]Passage One
[13:42.26]Choosing what to eat seems like a simple decision,
[13:46.00]but various factors have a role.
[13:49.04]Your environment, mood and amount of time
[13:52.10]you have all make a difference.
[13:55.30]These factors are directly affected
[13:57.91]by the American lifestyle and culture.
[14:01.81]The fast-paced, busy lives of Americans
[14:05.20]affect their food decisions in various ways.
[14:09.35]Americans should blame a ¡°terrible food environment¡±
[14:13.44]for the over-weight epidemic.
[14:16.33]Scientists pointed to the wide availability
[14:19.60]of high-fat and high-sugar foods,
[14:23.05]large serving sizes,
[14:25.12]advertisements for processed foods
[14:27.95]and lack of physical activity as reasons
[14:31.86]for Americans¡¯ weight gain.
[14:34.65]It is said that policy,
[14:36.62]not self-control,
[14:38.35]should be emphasized if Americans want to lose weight.
[14:43.31]Americans¡¯ fast-paced lifestyle may be
[14:47.13]a part to blame for their expanding waistline.
[14:51.27]Most ¡°convenience foods,¡±
[14:53.54]such as pre-packaged snacks or fast food,
[14:57.66]are nutritionally lacking and filled with
[15:01.16]too much fat and sugar.
[15:03.79]These foods lead to increased blood pressure
[15:07.33]because they are high in salt.
[15:10.10]Those watching their blood pressure
[15:12.35]should read food labels and watch
[15:14.92]for packages labeled low sugar.
[15:18.32]If you¡¯re watching your health,
[15:20.81]look for high-fiber foods labeled low fat.
[15:25.14]To eat these foods and still watch your weight,
[15:28.82]clinics recommend reading food labels,
[15:31.90]watching total calorie intake and eating foods high in fiber.
[15:37.75]The high stress level in many Americans¡¯ lives
[15:41.42]leaves them turning to rich,
[15:43.92]comfort foods.
[15:45.68]Long-term stress leads to love for high-fat,
[15:49.56]high-sugar foods.
[15:51.45]When under high levels of stress,
[15:54.36]there are other ways to deal with it,
[15:57.39]including exercise,
[15:59.16]yoga, etc.
[16:03.47]Questions 16 to 19 are based on the passage
[16:07.15]you have just heard.
[16:11.32]16. What directly affects the food decisions of Americans?
[16:32.70]17. What may cause Americans¡¯ over-weight
[16:36.88]epidemic according to scientists?
[16:55.54]18. What do clinics suggest people do to keep healthy?
[17:17.22]19. How has stress affected Americans?
[17:38.10]Passage Two
[17:39.53]Women hinder themselves on the job by frequently underrating
[17:44.35]their standing with bosses and co-workers,
[17:47.30]says a new study to be released
[17:49.45]in the Academy of Management¡¯s annual meeting.
[17:52.79]When asked to predict how they were rated by managers,
[17:56.89]direct reports and peers,
[17:58.95]women were significantly poorer
[18:01.32]at predicting others¡¯ ratings than men.
[18:04.43]A lack of self-confidence isn¡¯t the problem.
[18:08.37]The women surveyed thought highly of themselves
[18:11.69]compared with men in the study.
[18:14.01]But the females simply believed others regarded
[18:17.66]them as less competent than they actually did,
[18:21.29]on a wide range of social and emotional skills
[18:25.20]related to leadership,
[18:26.57]according to the study.
[18:28.63]The ratings included a wide range of attributes,
[18:32.18]from communication and conflict management
[18:35.14]to trustworthiness and teamwork.
[18:37.88]Overall, averaging all the ratings,
[18:41.29]the gap between prediction and reality
[18:43.81]was three times greater for women than for men.
[18:47.52]A few companies, of course, have fair,
[18:50.77]transparent, performance-based compensation
[18:53.92]systems that eliminate gender inequities.
[18:57.53]But at most employers,
[18:59.46]expecting to be devalued can pay a heavy price.
[19:03.58]A woman said she underestimated her standing
[19:07.24]at work for years and paid a high price in her paycheck.
[19:12.04]She started at a low-paid entry-level job
[19:15.56]at her company and advanced quickly up the ladder.
[19:19.53]But she didn¡¯t ask for a raise for several years,
[19:23.56]only to find out later that she was making 50%
[19:27.90]less than peers with similar or less experience.
[19:33.37]Questions 20 to 22 are based on the passage
[19:38.69]you have just heard.
[19:42.62]20. How do women think others rate them on the job?
[20:03.01]21. What does the speaker say about the women surveyed?
[20:23.77]22. What is the possible result for employees
[20:28.74]expecting to be devalued?
[20:46.36]Passage Three
[20:48.21]It¡¯s no big secret that men don¡¯t share their emotions easily.
[20:54.53]Numerous research studies and millions of puzzled
[20:57.50]women can prove that.
[20:59.90]But is it really so harmful if men want to keep
[21:03.22]their feelings hidden?
[21:05.47]And don¡¯t women share too much,
[21:07.68]complaining about their husbands to friends,
[21:10.88]co-workers and sometimes even strangers?
[21:15.13]The answer to both questions is an absolute yes.
[21:19.41]Men and women could learn a thing or two from each other
[21:23.20]about when to talk about problems in their marriages or romantic relationships.
[21:29.50]It might help men reveal more to others
[21:33.05]outside the relationship¡ª
[21:35.11]and women to talk about it a bit less.
[21:38.64]There are deep-rooted reasons why we share the way we do.
[21:43.97]Men don¡¯t want to appear vulnerable.
[21:47.34]Why won¡¯t they ask for directions when they¡¯re lost?
[21:51.37]They are raised to be strong,
[21:53.95]after all,
[21:54.83]not to appear sad,
[21:56.50]scared or needy.
[21:58.50]Women, by contrast,
[22:00.81]are taught it¡¯s OK to be emotional.
[22:04.27]Men also may button their lips to protect their wives
[22:08.57]or significant others,
[22:10.78]worrying that their friends might be insensitive
[22:14.07]or think less of their partners.
[22:17.30]They also may not want to get themselves annoyed
[22:21.38]because it¡¯s hard for them to calm down.
[22:24.61]Or, as a male friend of mine puts it:
[22:28.20]¡°Men don¡¯t talk about their feelings with themselves,
[22:32.49]let alone other men.
[22:34.84]They usually have something to feel guilty about,
[22:38.73]even if it¡¯s just a bad thought,
[22:41.47]so why look too closely?¡±
[22:46.72]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage
[22:50.41]you have just heard.
[22:54.37]23. What does the speaker say about men?
[23:14.46]24. What may cause the difference between men
[23:18.77]and women in expressing emotions?
[23:36.68]25. Why do men hide their feelings?
[23:57.50]Section C
[23:58.69]Directions: In this section,
[24:01.50]you will hear a passage three times.
[24:04.61]When the passage is read for the first time,
[24:07.54]you should listen carefully for its general idea.
[24:11.08]When the passage is read for the second time,
[24:13.96]you are required to fill in the blanks
[24:16.36]with the exact words you have just heard.
[24:19.39]Finally, when the passage is read for the third time,
[24:23.28]you should check what you have written.
[24:26.75]Now listen to the passage.
[24:29.57]Women know that a lack of sleep leaves them irritable.
[24:33.97]However, most of them are unaware of the damage
[24:37.51]it may be doing to their skin.
[24:40.57]Besides, being an essential component of a healthy lifestyle,
[24:45.25]getting eight hours of sleep per night helps improve their skin.
[24:50.47]During the night the skin is restored
[24:53.77]from the harmful effects of daily stress.
[24:56.98]When they do not get the required sleep their skin suffers.
[25:01.33]This is especially noticeable in the skin under the eyes.
[25:06.21]The under eye area is almost 50 percent thinner
[25:10.44]than the skin on the face.
[25:12.78]Sleepless nights leave behind fine lines,
[25:16.31]dark circles.
[25:17.60]Make-up treatments can soften the effects
[25:20.57]of sleep deprivation but preventive medicine is the best cure.
[25:25.72]Eye treatments are limited in their ability
[25:28.56]and cannot reverse the stress that a lack of sleep
[25:32.30]will do to the skin.
[25:34.63]Sleep experts say that women need eight hours of sleep per night.
[25:39.95]However, the latest research shows
[25:42.68]that women average six hours and forty minutes
[25:46.23]of sleep during the week and seven hours on the weekend.
[25:51.02]Besides the extra work that women have
[25:54.01]to contend with¡ªhelping with homework,
[25:57.15]laundry, cooking, etc.¡ªand many concerns
[26:00.85]that keep them from sleep,
[26:02.77]women are also kept awake by small children
[26:06.44]who wake during the night,
[26:09.00]teenagers coming home late,
[26:11.06]aging parents who get up during the night.
[26:18.02]Now the passage will be read again.
[26:21.90]Women know that a lack of sleep leaves them irritable.
[26:26.28]However, most of them are unaware of the damage
[26:29.93]it may be doing to their skin.
[26:33.11]Besides, being an essential component of a healthy lifestyle,
[26:37.47]getting eight hours of sleep per night helps improve their skin.
[26:42.68]During the night the skin is restored
[26:45.97]from the harmful effects of daily stress.
[26:49.04]When they do not get the required sleep their skin suffers.
[26:53.53]This is especially noticeable in the skin under the eyes.
[26:58.65]The under eye area is almost 50 percent thinner
[27:03.02]than the skin on the face.
[27:05.10]Sleepless nights leave behind fine lines,
[27:08.57]dark circles.
[27:09.89]Make-up treatments can soften the effects
[27:13.19]of sleep deprivation but preventive medicine is the best cure.
[27:18.03]Eye treatments are limited in their ability
[27:20.81]and cannot reverse the stress that a lack of sleep
[27:24.76]will do to the skin.
[27:26.98]Sleep experts say that women need eight hours of sleep per night.
[27:32.04]However, the latest research shows
[27:34.92]that women average six hours and forty minutes
[27:38.62]of sleep during the week and seven hours on the weekend.
[27:43.46]Besides the extra work that women have
[27:46.26]to contend with¡ªhelping with homework,
[27:49.29]laundry, cooking, etc.¡ªand many concerns
[27:53.36]that keep them from sleep,
[27:55.11]women are also kept awake by small children
[27:58.91]who wake during the night,
[28:01.29]teenagers coming home late,
[28:03.32]aging parents who get up during the night.
[28:09.76]Now the passage will be read for the third time.
[28:14.79]Women know that a lack of sleep leaves them irritable.
[28:19.22]However, most of them are unaware of the damage
[28:22.61]it may be doing to their skin.
[28:25.72]Besides, being an essential component of a healthy lifestyle,
[28:30.35]getting eight hours of sleep per night helps improve their skin.
[28:35.48]During the night the skin is restored
[28:39.02]from the harmful effects of daily stress.
[28:42.03]When they do not get the required sleep their skin suffers.
[28:46.42]This is especially noticeable in the skin under the eyes.
[28:51.15]The under eye area is almost 50 percent thinner
[28:55.56]than the skin on the face.
[28:57.93]Sleepless nights leave behind fine lines,
[29:01.41]dark circles.
[29:02.78]Make-up treatments can soften the effects
[29:05.89]of sleep deprivation but preventive medicine is the best cure.
[29:10.95]Eye treatments are limited in their ability
[29:13.74]and cannot reverse the stress that a lack of sleep
[29:17.60]will do to the skin.
[29:19.91]Sleep experts say that women need eight hours of sleep per night.
[29:25.06]However, the latest research shows
[29:27.89]that women average six hours and forty minutes
[29:31.32]of sleep during the week and seven hours on the weekend.
[29:36.22]Besides the extra work that women have
[29:39.20]to contend with¡ªhelping with homework,
[29:42.06]laundry, cooking, etc.¡ªand many concerns
[29:46.15]that keep them from sleep,
[29:47.90]women are also kept awake by small children
[29:51.69]who wake during the night,
[29:54.20]teenagers coming home late,
[29:56.21]aging parents who get up during the night.
[30:02.38]This is the end of listening comprehension.
