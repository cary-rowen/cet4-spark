[00:16.51]Model Test Four
[00:18.26]Section A
[00:19.65]Directions: In this section, 
[00:21.80]you will hear 8 short conversations 
[00:24.52]and 2 long conversations. 
[00:27.25]At the end of each conversation, 
[00:30.03]one or more questions will be asked 
[00:32.65]about what was said. 
[00:34.42]Both the conversation and the questions 
[00:37.75]will be spoken only once. 
[00:40.41]After each question there will be a pause. 
[00:43.85]During the pause, 
[00:45.46]you must read the four choices 
[00:48.02]marked A), B), C) and D), 
[00:51.10]and decide which is the best answer. 
[00:54.36]Then mark the corresponding letter 
[00:57.23]on Answer Sheet 1 
[00:58.87]with a single line through the centre. 
[01:01.86]Now let¡¯s begin with the eight short conversations.
[01:06.70]1. M: I¡¯ve heard 
[01:08.48]the modern art exhibition in the university museum is great 
[01:12.96]and I¡¯ve been trying to get there, 
[01:15.08]but I¡¯m so busy with papers for my classes.
[01:18.57]W: Well, it won¡¯t be here much longer, 
[01:20.96]you really ought to make time for it!
[01:23.94]Q: What does the woman suggest the man do?
[01:42.15]2. W: I¡¯ve been looking all over for Peter. 
[01:46.22]I got his book that he left behind in the cafeteria. 
[01:50.11]He might need it for his test tomorrow.
[01:52.76]M: I met him a few minutes ago 
[01:55.03]and he said he was heading for the study hall 
[01:58.07]at the student center.
[01:59.78]Q: What will the woman probably do next?
[02:17.59]3. W: I have to cut back on my expenses on clothing. 
[02:22.58]I¡¯m almost broke.
[02:24.45]M: Yeah, I won¡¯t lend you a cent 
[02:27.19]if you go on buying clothes like this.
[02:30.25]Q: What do we know about the woman?
[02:47.15]4. M: All the photos I took on my trip 
[02:51.51]with my new camera were ruined. 
[02:54.03]For some reasons, 
[02:55.27]the film didn¡¯t advance through the camera.
[02:58.46]W: Well, did you read the instruction carefully 
[03:01.11]before using it?
[03:02.88]Q: What does the woman imply?
[03:20.03]5. W: I can¡¯t believe I missed the deadline 
[03:23.88]for the discount basketball tickets.
[03:26.63]M: Oh, don¡¯t worry. 
[03:28.03]Now it¡¯s only for the general public. 
[03:31.10]University students can¡¯t buy 
[03:33.45]till the end of this month.
[03:35.12]Q: What does the man imply?
[03:51.99]6. M: It¡¯s so hard for me 
[03:55.33]to get to the morning class. 
[03:57.46]But I¡¯m going to fail 
[03:58.87]if I keep skipping. 
[04:00.74]I could hardly keep my eyes open 
[04:03.17]before 10:00 a.m.
[04:04.97]W: Getting up early is a nightmare.
[04:07.41]Q: What can we know according to the conversation?
[04:24.99]7. M:  It¡¯s already 7:45. 
[04:29.62]Have the children left for school yet?
[04:32.20]W: Bob left 20 minutes ago 
[04:34.10]and Jane, late as usual, 10 minutes later.
[04:38.07]Q: What time did Jane leave?
[04:55.21]8. W: Is there a seat for the concert tomorrow?
[04:59.05]M: No seats left, 
[05:00.53]but we sell standing-room tickets 
[05:03.28]two hours before the performance.
[05:05.59]Q: What does the man mean?
[05:22.67]Now you¡¯ll hear the two long conversations.
[05:26.87]Conversation One
[05:28.87]W: Hi, Jim, I have something urgent 
[05:31.45]to talk over with you. 
[05:33.03]Could you spare a few minutes right now?
[05:35.47]M: Sure, come in and take a seat, please. 
[05:38.40]What¡¯s on your mind?
[05:39.64]W: I was just talking to the library supervisor. 
[05:42.90]He said the main frame was repaired yesterday. 
[05:46.32]That helps a lot, 
[05:47.81]but there are some other problems 
[05:49.63]with our students.
[05:51.18]M: Again? What¡¯s the problem this time?
[05:54.39]W: He said the students were supposed to 
[05:56.51]reserve the terminal computers 
[05:58.54]for only one hour a day 
[06:00.95]because so many students need to 
[06:03.16]use them every day.
[06:04.81]M: We¡¯ve already made it as a regulation
[06:07.53]to reserve the terminals within the hour given, 
[06:10.80]haven¡¯t we?
[06:11.69]W: Yes, we have. 
[06:12.95]But quite a number of our students 
[06:15.19]are required to accomplish such assignments 
[06:18.31]as designs and researches 
[06:20.39]towards the end of the semester.
[06:22.62]M: I can see that. 
[06:23.93]But does it bring about any problems?
[06:26.30]W: Well, now it frequently occurs 
[06:28.76]that some of our students aren¡¯t willing to 
[06:31.72]give up terminals when their hour is over.
[06:34.60]M: I suppose they feel 
[06:36.35]that since they are almost done, 
[06:38.38]a few more minutes won¡¯t matter.
[06:40.67]W: Yes, most likely. 
[06:42.25]But this renders it inconvenient for people 
[06:45.12]who are waiting for their turn 
[06:47.13]to use the machine.
[06:48.43]M: You¡¯re right. 
[06:49.45]Let¡¯s draft the memo right now. 
[06:51.85]We can pass it out in our classes tomorrow 
[06:54.83]to clear up the problem. 
[06:56.59]To make it known to all 
[06:58.53]will be crucial to the solution.
[07:00.46]W: I agree. 
[07:01.60]And now I consider it a necessity 
[07:04.12]to tighten the control over the time limits.
[07:07.14]M: OK. Let¡¯s get started right away.
[07:12.03]Questions 9 to 12 are based on the conversation 
[07:15.99]you have just heard.
[07:19.86]9. Who are the speakers?
[07:38.03]10. How long is each student allowed 
[07:42.12]to use the terminal computers?
[07:59.29]11. What is one of the problems 
[08:02.76]in the library?
[08:19.22]12. What are the speakers going to do next 
[08:23.68]to solve the problem?
[08:40.32]Conversation Two
[08:42.44]M: Take a seat, please. 
[08:43.74]What do you do at the moment? 
[08:45.53]W: I¡¯m a personal assistant to the manager 
[08:48.04]of a modeling agency. 
[08:50.03]M: You work with people a lot, do you? 
[08:52.47]W: Oh, yes. I have to look after all the models 
[08:56.08]who work for us, 
[08:57.23]you know, keep them happy, 
[08:59.12]lend an understanding ear to their regrets.
[09:02.51]M: Have you ever done anything 
[09:04.77]with hotels or conferences¡ª
[09:07.18]hotel management, for instance? 
[09:09.12]W: No, not really. 
[09:10.61]I did work for a short time 
[09:12.62]for a tour operator, 
[09:14.24]taking foreigners on guided tours of London. 
[09:17.60]Perhaps that¡¯s the sort of thing you mean. 
[09:20.31]M: Yes, I think it is. 
[09:22.38]And what about any exams you¡¯ve taken? 
[09:25.26]W: Well, I left school at 16. 
[09:27.93]M: So you have no formal qualifications at all? 
[09:31.29]Well, I don¡¯t suppose it matters. 
[09:33.49]W: I was wondering 
[09:34.43]if you could tell me a bit more 
[09:36.24]about the job. 
[09:37.45]M: Well, we run conferences, 
[09:39.47]and your job as a conference coordinator 
[09:42.33]would be much the same 
[09:44.21]as the one you are doing now, I suppose¡ª
[09:47.40]meeting people, transporting them 
[09:49.89]from one place to another, 
[09:52.02]making sure they¡¯re comfortable, 
[09:53.88]a bit of telephoning, and so on.
[09:56.18]W: It sounds like just the sort of thing 
[09:58.22]I want to do.
[09:59.36]M: Perhaps you¡¯d care to 
[10:01.25]have a quick look round the office here, 
[10:03.68]see if you like the people who work here.
[10:06.26]W: That¡¯s very nice of you. 
[10:07.79]Thank you.
[10:10.80]Questions 13 to 15 are based on the conversation 
[10:14.78]you have just heard.
[10:18.03]13. What does the woman do 
[10:21.58]for her present job?
[10:38.33]14. What kind of job is the woman applying for?
[10:57.25]15. What will the woman do next 
[11:01.64]according to the conversation?
[11:17.88]Section B
[11:19.06]Directions: In this section, 
[11:21.39]you will hear 3 short passages. 
[11:24.23]At the end of each passage, 
[11:26.35]you will hear some questions. 
[11:28.46]Both the passage and the questions 
[11:31.09]will be spoken only once. 
[11:33.61]After you hear a question,
[11:35.72]you must choose the best answer 
[11:38.09]from the four choices 
[11:39.65]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[11:42.76]Then mark the corresponding letter 
[11:45.36]on Answer Sheet 1 
[11:47.21]with a single line through the centre.
[11:51.09]Passage One
[11:52.27]The average family spends about 
[11:54.46]one sixth of its income on food. 
[11:57.50]Because food is expensive, 
[11:59.65]it is important to spend money wisely 
[12:02.23]when you shop. 
[12:03.49]A careful shopper can 
[12:05.50]prepare nutritious and delicious meals inexpensively. 
[12:09.83]Here are some hints 
[12:11.64]to help you shop better.
[12:13.33]Buy only the food that you need. 
[12:15.78]There are several ways 
[12:17.24]to avoid buying extra food. 
[12:19.61]First, make a shopping list 
[12:22.11]before you go to the store. 
[12:24.20]Then, when you are at the store, 
[12:27.15]follow your list carefully. 
[12:29.19]Furthermore, do not go shopping 
[12:31.90]if you are hungry. 
[12:33.62]When you are hungry, 
[12:35.15]food looks very delicious 
[12:37.08]and you want to buy more than you need. 
[12:39.64]Finally, go shopping alone if you can. 
[12:43.08]If you shop with young children, 
[12:45.33]they often ask you to 
[12:47.10]buy them unnecessary food like candy. 
[12:50.19]When you have a selection, 
[12:52.11]choose the least expensive brand of a product. 
[12:55.84]There are three points to remember 
[12:57.81]when you buy a can of tomatoes, for example. 
[13:01.40]First, look at the advertisements in the newspaper
[13:04.79]to see if your supermarket is 
[13:07.00]having a ¡°special¡± on canned tomatoes. 
[13:10.40]In addition, when you are in the store, 
[13:13.25]you should check the price per pound of tomatoes. 
[13:16.73]Sometimes you save money 
[13:18.71]if you buy the larger-sized can; 
[13:21.30]sometimes, however, you don¡¯t. 
[13:23.93]Third, remember that a grade A product 
[13:26.98]or a more expensive product 
[13:29.21]is not necessarily more healthy 
[13:31.79]than a grade B or less expensive product. 
[13:35.69]Grade A tomatoes may look better, 
[13:38.45]but all canned tomatoes have the same nutrients.
[13:43.91]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage 
[13:48.04]you have just heard.
[13:51.57]16. What does the speaker mainly talk about?
[14:12.07]17. What is the suggestion to help shop better?
[14:32.15]18. Why does the speaker advise to 
[14:36.05]read the advertisements in the newspaper before shopping?
[14:55.06]Passage Two
[14:56.56]If parents bring up a child 
[14:58.41]with the aim of turning him into a genius, 
[15:01.72]they will cause a disaster. 
[15:04.14]According to several leading educational psychologists, 
[15:08.04]this is one of the biggest mistakes 
[15:10.63]that ambitious parents make. 
[15:13.14]Generally, the child will be only too aware of 
[15:16.53]what the parent expects, and will fail. 
[15:19.51]Unrealistic parental expectations can 
[15:22.40]cause great damage to children. 
[15:25.10]However, if parents are not too unrealistic about 
[15:28.92]what they expect their children to do, 
[15:31.51]but are ambitious in a sensible way, 
[15:34.45]the child may succeed in doing very well¡ª
[15:38.01]especially if the parents are very supportive of their child. 
[15:42.34]Michael Li is very lucky. 
[15:45.08]He is crazy about music, 
[15:47.26]and his parents help him a lot
[15:49.60]by taking him to concerts 
[15:51.78]and arranging private piano and violin lessons for him. 
[15:56.34]Although Michael¡¯s mother knows very little about music, 
[16:00.62]Michael¡¯s father plays the trumpet in a large orchestra. 
[16:04.79]However, he never makes Michael enter music competitions 
[16:09.48]if he is unwilling to do so. 
[16:12.09]Michael¡¯s friend, Winston Chen, however, 
[16:15.37]is not so lucky. 
[16:17.16]Although both his parents are successful musicians, 
[16:20.72]they set too high a standard for him. 
[16:23.95]They want him to be as successful as they are, 
[16:27.30]so they enter him in every piano competition held. 
[16:31.76]They are very unhappy when he doesn¡¯t win. 
[16:35.55]¡°When I was your age, 
[16:37.17]I used to win every competition I entered.¡± 
[16:40.69]Winston¡¯s father tells him. 
[16:42.81]Winston is always afraid 
[16:44.94]that he will disappoint his parents 
[16:47.61]and now he always seems quiet and unhappy.
[16:53.37]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage 
[16:58.13]you have just heard.
[17:01.29]19. What is the right attitude in bringing up a child?
[17:21.56]20. What can we learn about Winston Chen¡¯s parents?
[17:41.40]21. Why does Winston Chen always seem quiet and unhappy?
[18:02.01]Passage Three
[18:03.82]As any homemaker who has tried to keep order 
[18:07.36]at the dinner table knows, 
[18:09.07]there is far more to a family meal than food. 
[18:12.79]Sociologist Michael Lewis has been studying 50 families 
[18:17.88]to find out just how much more. 
[18:20.68]Lewis and his co-workers carried out their study 
[18:24.14]by videotaping the families 
[18:26.41]while they ate ordinary meals in their own homes. 
[18:30.01]They found that parents with small families 
[18:33.07]talked actively with each other and their children. 
[18:36.65]But as the number of children got larger, 
[18:39.69]conversation gave way to the parents¡¯ efforts 
[18:42.96]to control the loud noise they made. 
[18:45.71]That can have an important effect on the children. 
[18:49.01]¡°In general, the more question-asking the parents do, 
[18:53.22]the higher the children¡¯s IQ scores are,¡± Lewis says, 
[18:57.50]¡°and the more children there are, 
[18:59.52]the less question-asking there is.¡±¡¡
[19:02.47]The study also provides an explanation 
[19:05.36]for why middle children often seem to 
[19:08.99]have a harder time in life 
[19:10.97]than their brothers and sisters. 
[19:13.26]Lewis finds that in families 
[19:15.43]with three or four children, 
[19:17.30]dinner conversation is likely to 
[19:20.22]center on the oldest child, 
[19:22.01]who has the most to talk about, 
[19:24.16]and the youngest, who needs the most attention. 
[19:27.69]¡°Middle children are invisible,¡± says Lewis. 
[19:31.07]¡°When you see someone get up from the table 
[19:33.81]and walk around during dinner, 
[19:35.85]it¡¯s often the case that it¡¯s the middle child.¡± 
[19:39.35]There is, however, one thing that stops all conversation 
[19:43.45]and prevents anyone from having attention.
[19:46.27] ¡°When the TV is on,¡± Lewis says, 
[19:48.96]¡°dinner is a non-event.¡±
[19:53.61]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage 
[19:58.01]you have just heard.
[20:01.82]22. What is the purpose of the passage?
[20:21.41]23. Why do parents with larger families 
[20:25.92]ask fewer questions at dinner?
[20:43.85]24. Which statement would the speaker 
[20:47.83]probably agree with?
[21:04.91]25. What will prevent all conversation at dinner?
[21:24.81]Section C
[21:26.21]Directions: In this section, 
[21:29.00]you will hear a passage three times. 
[21:32.14]When the passage is read for the first time, 
[21:35.01]you should listen carefully for its general idea. 
[21:38.78]When the passage is read for the second time, 
[21:42.04]you are required to fill in the blanks 
[21:44.90]with the exact words you have just heard. 
[21:47.89]Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, 
[21:52.14]you should check what you have written. 
[21:54.62]Now listen to the passage.
[25:39.95][23:48.62][21:58.35]The world is not only hungry, 
[25:42.22][23:51.11][22:00.68]but thirsty for water. 
[25:44.11][23:53.27][22:02.60]That may seem strange to you, 
[25:46.24][23:55.51][22:04.72]since nearly 75% of the earth¡¯s surface is covered with water, 
[25:50.81][24:00.63][22:09.16]but about 97% of this huge amount 
[25:54.50][24:04.31][22:12.88]is sea water, or salt water. 
[25:57.00][24:07.28][22:15.37]Men can only drink and use the other 3%¡ª
[26:01.45][24:11.16][22:19.82]the fresh water from rivers, lakes, underground, and other sources. 
[26:06.53][24:16.47][22:24.88]And we cannot even use all of that, 
[26:09.54][24:19.79][22:27.83]because some of it is 
[26:11.03][24:21.41][22:29.48]in the form of icebergs and glaciers. 
[26:13.55][24:24.11][22:32.14]Even worse, some of it has been polluted. 
[26:17.35][24:27.41][22:35.70]However, this small amount of fresh water
[26:20.35][24:30.46][22:38.93]is still enough for us, 
[26:22.21][24:32.38][22:40.81]but our need for water is increasing rapidly. 
[26:25.87][24:36.38][22:44.54]Only if we take steps to 
[26:27.94][24:38.64][22:46.40]deal with the problem now 
[26:29.80][24:39.99][22:48.22]can we avoid a severe worldwide water shortage later on. 
[26:34.98][24:45.44][22:53.56]One of the first steps is 
[26:36.88][24:47.53][22:55.52]to develop ways of reusing it. 
[26:39.30][24:50.03][22:57.85]Today water is used only once 
[26:42.85][24:52.99][23:01.31]and then discharged into a sewer system, 
[26:45.48][24:56.40][23:04.10]and it eventually returns to the sea 
[26:48.74][24:58.81][23:07.29]or runs into underground storage tanks. 
[26:52.98][25:02.57][23:11.65]It is possible to pipe used water to a purifying plant. 
[26:57.87][25:07.02][23:16.36]There it can be filtered and treated with chemicals 
[27:01.65][25:10.76][23:20.13]so that it can be used again.
[27:04.17][25:13.15][23:22.59]Even if every large city purified and reused its water,
