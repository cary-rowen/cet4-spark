[00:18.06]Model Test Fourteen
[00:21.08]Section A
[00:22.68]Directions: In this section,
[00:25.16]you will hear 8 short conversations
[00:28.14]and 2 long conversations.
[00:31.45]At the end of each conversation,
[00:33.79]one or more questions will
[00:35.54]be asked about what was said.
[00:38.17]Both the conversation and the questions
[00:40.91]will be spoken only once.
[00:43.65]After each question there will be a pause.
[00:47.58]During the pause,
[00:48.90]you must read the four choices
[00:51.00]marked A),B), C), and D),
[00:54.53]and decide which is the best answer.
[00:57.53]Then mark the corresponding letter
[00:59.83]on Answer Sheet 1 with a single line
[01:01.90]through the centre.
[01:05.06]Now let's begin with the eight short conversations.
[01:10.52]1. M: Oh my god! The heat is simply unbearable here.
[01:16.64]I wish we've gone to the beach instead.
[01:19.78]W: Well, with the museums and restaurants in Washington,
[01:23.58]I'll be happy here no matter what the temperature.
[01:27.41]Q£ºWhat does the woman mean?
[01:45.04]2. M: How's the new job going?
[01:49.94]W: Well, I'm learning a lot of new things,
[01:52.82]but I wish the director would give me some feedback.
[01:57.48]Q£ºWhat does the woman want to know?
[02:16.41]3. W: Can you help me work out
[02:19.59]a physical training program, John?
[02:22.35]M: Sure, but whatever you do,
[02:24.60]be careful not to overdo it.
[02:26.90]Last time I had two weeks' worth of
[02:28.97]weight-lifting in three days and I hurt myself.
[02:33.22]Q: What does the man suggest the woman do?
[02:52.04]4. M: I have an elderly mother
[02:55.38]and I'm worried about her going on a plane.
[02:58.31]Is there any risk?
[03:00.22]W: Not if her heart is all right.
[03:02.61]If she has a heart condition,
[03:04.76]I'd recommend against it.
[03:07.77]Q: What does the man want to know about his mother?
[03:26.89]5. M: Why didn't you stop when we first signaled you
[03:31.15]at the crossroads?
[03:33.20]W: Sorry, I was just a bit absent-minded.
[03:37.11]Anyway, do I have to pay a fine?
[03:40.99]Q: What do we learn from the conversation?
[03:59.54]6. M: I'm no expert,
[04:03.02]but that noise in your refrigerator doesn't sound right.
[04:06.79]Maybe you should have it fixed.
[04:08.69]W: You're right.
[04:09.75]And I suppose I've put it off long enough.
[04:13.65]Q: What will the woman probably do?
[04:31.61]7. M: I did extremely well on the sale of
[04:36.11]my downtown apartment.
[04:38.01]Now, I have enough money to buy that piece of land
[04:41.12]I've had my eye on and build a house on it.
[04:45.17]W: Congratulations! Does that mean you'll be moving soon?
[04:50.20]Q: What do we learn about the man from the conversation?
[05:09.74]8. W: My hand still hurts from the fall
[05:13.55]on the ice yesterday.
[05:15.23]I wonder if I broke something.
[05:17.55]M: I'm no doctor,
[05:18.70]but it's not black and blue or anything.
[05:21.42]Maybe you just need to rest it for a few days.
[05:25.86]Q: What do we learn about the woman from the conversation?
[05:45.25]Now you will hear the two long conversations.
[05:50.31]Conversation One
[05:52.54]M: Mrs. Dawson, thanks very much for coming down to the station.
[05:56.81]I just like to go over some of the things
[05:59.53]that you told police officer Parmer at the bank.
[06:03.04]W: All right.
[06:04.25]M: Well, could you describe the man who robbed the bank
[06:07.53]for this report that we're filling out here?
[06:10.16]Now, anything at all that you can remember
[06:12.87]would be extremely helpful to us.
[06:15.89]W: Well, just, I can only remember basically
[06:20.75]what I said before.
[06:22.21]M: That's all right.
[06:24.61]W: The man was tall, er, six foot,
[06:27.51]and he had dark hair, and he had a moustache.
[06:31.63]M: Very good.
[06:32.64]All right, did he have any other distinguishing marks?
[06:36.56]W: Um, no, none that I can remember.
[06:40.51]M: Do you remember how old he was by any chance?
[06:44.36]W: Er, well, I guess around 30,
[06:47.65]maybe younger, give or take a few years.
[06:50.22]M: Uh, all right.
[06:51.77]Do you remember anything about what he was wearing?
[06:55.32]W: Yes, yes, he had on a dark sweater,
[06:59.16]a...a solid color.
[07:01.94]M: OK. Um, anything else that strikes you at the moment?
[07:06.25]W: I remember he was wearing a light shirt under the sweater.
[07:09.73]Yes, yes.
[07:11.83]M: All right. Mrs. Dawson, I really appreciate
[07:14.38]what you've been through today.
[07:16.42]I'm just going to ask you to look at some photographs
[07:19.30]before you leave if you don't mind.
[07:21.90]It won't take very long.
[07:23.76]Can you do that for me?
[07:25.48]W: Oh, of course.
[07:27.16]M: Would you like to step this way with me, please?
[07:30.13]W: OK, sure.
[07:31.96]M: Thank you.
[07:35.85]Questions 9 to 11 are based on the conversation
[07:38.84]you have just heard.
[07:43.46]9. What do we learn about the woman?
[08:03.32]10. What did the suspect look like?
[08:23.70]11. What did the man finally ask the woman to do?
[08:45.01]Conversation Two
[08:47.54]W: Good morning, I'm calling
[08:48.90]about the job that was in the paper last night.
[08:52.15]M: Well, could you tell me your name?
[08:55.13]W: Candider Forsett.
[08:57.63]M: Oh yes. What exactly is it that interests you about the job?
[09:03.29]W: Well, I thought it was just right for me.
[09:06.70]M: Really? Hmm...could you tell me a little about yourself?
[09:11.46]W: Yes. I'm 23. I've been working abroad.
[09:15.35]M: Where exactly have you been working?
[09:17.76]W: In Geneva.
[09:19.26]M: Oh, Geneva. And what were you doing there?
[09:22.96]W: Secretarial work. Previous to that, I was at university.
[09:27.27]M: Which university was that?
[09:29.55]W: The University of Manchester.
[09:31.86]I've got a degree in English.
[09:33.86]M: You said you've been working in Geneva.
[09:36.57]Do you have any special reason for wanting to come back?
[09:40.43]W: I thought it would be nice to be near to the family.
[09:43.42]M: I see, and how do you see yourself developing in this job?
[09:47.83]W: Well, I'm ambitious.
[09:49.79]I do hope that my career as a secretary
[09:52.47]will lead me eventually into management.
[09:55.11]M: I see. You have foreign languages?
[09:58.67]W: French and Italian.
[10:00.19]M: Well, I think the best thing for you to do
[10:03.04]is to reply in writing to the advertisement.
[10:06.41]W: Can't I arrange for an interview now?
[10:09.27]M: Well, I'm afraid we must wait
[10:11.33]until all the applications are in, in writing,
[10:14.47]and we'll then decide on the short list.
[10:17.26]If you are on the short list,
[10:19.02]of course we should see you.
[10:20.90]W: Oh, I see.
[10:22.93]M: I'll look forward to receiving your application
[10:25.18]in writing in a day or two.
[10:27.09]W: Oh, yes, yes, certainly.
[10:30.34]M: OK, thank you very much. Goodbye.
[10:34.14]W: Thank you. Goodbye.
[10:38.35]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation
[10:41.81]you have just heard.
[10:45.60]12. How did the woman get to know about the job vacancy?
[11:07.35]13. Why did the woman find the job appealing?
[11:28.46]14. What had the woman been doing in Geneva?
[11:49.78]15. What was the woman asked to do in the end?
[12:11.67]Section B
[12:13.55]Directions: In this section,
[12:15.95]you will hear 3 short passages.
[12:19.23]At the end of each passage,
[12:21.45]you will hear some questions.
[12:23.56]Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once.
[12:28.06]After you hear a question,
[12:30.01]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[12:33.96]marked A), B), C) and D).
[12:37.54]Then mark the corresponding letter
[12:39.87]on Answer Sheet 1 with a single line through the centre.
[12:45.32]Passage One
[12:47.31]One of the greatest heartbreaks for fire fighters occurs
[12:50.41]when they fail to rescue a child from a burning building
[12:54.22]because the child,
[12:55.53]frightened by smoke and noise,
[12:57.63]hides under a bed or in a closet and is later found dead.
[13:02.31]Saddest of all is when children catch a glimpse
[13:05.13]of the masked fire fighter but hide
[13:07.63]because they think they have seen a monster.
[13:10.83]To prevent such tragedies,
[13:12.83]fire fighter Eric Velez gives talks to children in his community,
[13:17.88]explaining that they should never hide during a fire.
[13:21.85]He displays fire fighters' equipment,
[13:24.37]including the oxygen mask,
[13:26.62]which he encourages his listeners to play with and put on.
[13:30.55]¡°If you see us,¡± Velez tells them,
[13:33.96]¡°don't hide! We are not monsters.
[13:36.94]We have come to rescue you.¡±
[13:39.53]Velez gives his presentations in English and Spanish.
[13:43.34]Growing up in San Francisco,
[13:45.87]he learnt Spanish from his immigrant parents.
[13:48.90]Velez and other fire fighters throughout North America,
[13:53.01]who give similar presentations,
[13:55.13]will never know how many lives
[13:57.42]they save through their talks.
[13:59.84]But it's a fact that informative speaking saves lives.
[14:04.94]For example, several months
[14:07.27]after listening to an informative speech,
[14:10.08]Pete Gentry in North Carolina rescued his brother
[14:13.49]who was choking on food,
[14:15.48]by using the method taught by student speaker, Julie Perris.
[14:20.19]In addition to saving lives,
[14:22.79]informative speakers help people learn new skills,
[14:26.59]solve problems and acquire fascinating facts
[14:29.73]about the exciting world in which they live.
[14:34.80]Questions 16 to 19 are based on the passage
[14:38.12]you have just heard.
[14:42.34]16. Why do some children trapped in a burning building
[14:48.15]hide from masked fire fighters?
[15:05.93]17. What does the passage tell us about
[15:10.64]fire fighter Eric Velez?
[15:28.28]18. What do we learn about Pete Gentry?
[15:48.76]19. What message is the speaker trying to convey?
[16:10.12]Passage Two
[16:11.91]Some people want to make and save a lot of money
[16:15.17]in order to retire early.
[16:17.78]I see people pursuing higher paying
[16:20.22]and increasingly demanding careers
[16:22.57]to accomplish this goal.
[16:24.70]They make many personal sacrifices
[16:27.13]in exchange for income today.
[16:29.45]The problem is that tomorrow might not come.
[16:32.94]Even if it all goes according to plan,
[16:35.24]will you know how to be happy when you are not working
[16:38.99]if you spend your entire life making money?
[16:42.06]More importantly, who will be around
[16:45.22]for you to share your leisure time with?
[16:47.93]At the other extreme are people who live only for today.
[16:51.72]Why bother saving when I might not be here tomorrow£¿
[16:55.93]They argue.
[16:57.27]The danger of this approach is
[16:58.79]that tomorrow may come after all.
[17:01.17]And most people don't want to spend
[17:03.87]all their tomorrows working for a living.
[17:07.05]The earlier neglect of saving, however,
[17:09.88]makes it difficult not to work when you are older.
[17:13.37]You may be surprised to hear me say that
[17:16.33]if you must pick an extreme,
[17:18.55]I think it's better to pick the spend-all approach.
[17:21.77]As long as you don't mind continuing to work,
[17:24.60]assuming your health allows, you should be OK.
[17:27.73]At least, you are making use of your money,
[17:30.27]and hopefully deriving value and pleasure from it.
[17:33.46]Postponing doing what you love and being with people
[17:36.88]you love until retirement can be a mistake.
[17:40.19]It may never come.
[17:42.05]Retirement can be a great time for some people.
[17:45.45]For others, it is a time of boredom,
[17:48.44]loneliness and poor health.
[17:52.59]Questions 20 to 22 are based on the passage
[17:56.18]you have just heard.
[18:00.17]20. Why do some people pursue
[18:03.14]higher paying but demanding careers?
[18:21.45]21. What is the danger facing people
[18:25.68]who live only for today?
[18:43.23]22. What does the speaker seem to advocate?
[19:04.13]Passage Three
[19:05.64]Imagine that someone in your neighborhood broke the law,
[19:09.22]and the judge put the whole neighborhood under suspicion.
[19:13.17]How fair would that be?
[19:15.49]Well, it happens every day to high schoolers.
[19:18.68]Just because some students have stolen things in shops,
[19:22.39]all of us are treated like thieves.
[19:25.18]Even though I'd never steal,
[19:27.48]store employees looked at me like
[19:29.54]I'm some kind of hardened criminal.
[19:32.15]For example, during one lunch period,
[19:35.08]my friend Denny and I went to the Grab and Go Restaurant
[19:38.70]to have a hotdog.
[19:40.25]We arrived to find a line of students waiting outside.
[19:44.72]A new sign in the window told the story¡ª
[19:47.51]¡°No more than two students at a time.¡±
[19:51.04]After 15 minutes, we finally got in.
[19:54.59]But the store manager laid the evil eye on us.
[19:58.31]I asked him about the new sign, and he said,
[20:01.82]¡°You kids are stealing too much stuff.¡±
[20:05.46]You kids? Too much stuff?
[20:09.00]We were not only assumed to be thieves,
[20:11.37]but brilliant, greedy thieves.
[20:14.47]The most annoying thing, though,
[20:16.09]is the way employees watched my friends and me.
[20:19.90]It's horrible.
[20:21.52]Once, at a drug store,
[20:23.09]I was looking around and found a guy standing
[20:26.03]on a large box,
[20:27.51]stocking the shelves.
[20:29.44]He was watching my hands,
[20:31.47]more than he was watching his own.
[20:33.77]I showed him that my hands were empty.
[20:36.57]He got down off his box and rushed off,
[20:39.66]as if he was going to get the store manager.
[20:42.75]How crazy is that!
[20:46.71]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage
[20:50.80]you have just heard.
[20:55.05]23. What does the speaker find to be unfair?
[21:16.44]24. What measure did the Grab and Go Restaurant
[21:21.61]take to stop stealing?
[21:39.48]25. What happened in a drug store
[21:43.83]that greatly annoyed the speaker?
[22:02.61]Section C
[22:04.36]Directions: In this section,
[22:07.09]you will hear a passage three times.
[22:10.32]When the passage is read for the first time,
[22:12.82]you should listen carefully for its general idea.
[22:16.77]When the passage is read for the second time,
[22:19.80]you are required to fill in the blanks
[22:22.25]with the exact words you have just heard.
[22:25.83]Finally, when the passage is read for the third time,
[22:29.79]you should check what you have written.
[22:32.49]Now listen to the passage.
[22:35.99]Writing keeps us in touch with other people.
[22:39.37]We write to communicate with relatives and friends.
[22:42.81]We write to preserve our family histories
[22:46.09]so our children and grandchildren can learn
[22:48.86]and appreciate their heritage.
[22:51.10]With computers and Internet connections
[22:53.98]in so many households, colleges, and businesses,
[22:57.42]people are e-mailing friends and relatives all the time¡ª
[23:01.19]or talking to them in writing in online chat rooms.
[23:05.11]It is cheaper than calling long distance,
[23:08.05]and a lot more convenient than waiting
[23:10.27]until Sunday for the telephone rates to drop.
[23:14.21]Students are e-mailing their professors
[23:16.46]to receive and discuss their classroom assignments
[23:19.35]and to submit them.
[23:21.61]They are e-mailing classmates to discuss
[23:24.05]and collaborate on homework.
[23:26.37]They are also sharing information
[23:28.46]about concerts and sports events,
[23:30.96]as well as jokes and their philosophies of life.
[23:34.71]Despite the growing importance of computers, however,
[23:38.81]there will always be a place
[23:41.00]and need for the personal letter.
[23:43.54]A hand-written note to a friend or a family member
[23:46.93]is the best way to communicate important thoughts.
[23:50.45]No matter what the content of the message,
[23:53.05]its real point is,
[23:54.69]"I want you to know that I care about you."
[23:58.60]This writing practice brings rewards
[24:00.72]that can't be seen in bank accounts,
[24:03.36]but only in the success of human relationships.
[24:10.13]Now the passage will be read again.
[24:13.97]Writing keeps us in touch with other people.
[24:17.68]We write to communicate with relatives and friends.
[24:21.20]We write to preserve our family histories
