[00:16.65]Model Test Eight
[00:19.59]Section A
[00:21.10]Directions: In this section,
[00:24.09]you will hear 8 short conversations
[00:26.79]and 2 long conversations.
[00:29.69]At the end of each conversation,
[00:32.34]one or more questions will be asked
[00:35.00]about what was said.
[00:36.76]Both the conversation and the questions
[00:39.54]will be spoken only once.
[00:42.06]After each question there will be a pause.
[00:45.09]During the pause,
[00:46.93]you must read the four choices
[00:49.33]marked A), B), C) and D),
[00:53.21]and decide which is the best answer.
[00:56.70]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[01:01.09]with a single line through the centre.
[01:04.79]Now let¡¯s begin with the eight short conversations.
[01:10.41]1. M: Look! I¡¯m going to take down those oil paintings
[01:15.34]and put up new ones on the wall.
[01:17.51]What do you think?
[01:19.11]W: Why? What¡¯s wrong with them?
[01:21.23]They always look splendid in our house.
[01:24.25]Q: What does the woman think about the oil paintings?
[01:43.35]2. M: You should see the new singing program on TV.
[01:48.34]It is very touching, I think.
[01:50.75]It is at 8:30 on every Friday evening.
[01:54.37]W:  Normally I wouldn¡¯t,
[01:55.98]but this time I would as you recommend so strongly.
[02:00.63]Q: What is the woman¡¯s usual attitude towards singing programs?
[02:20.85]3. W: The snow is going to continue tomorrow.
[02:24.75]I wanted to take you to see the park,
[02:27.59]but it¡¯s too slippery for that,
[02:29.52]and it¡¯s obvious that we can¡¯t walk around to visit the sights
[02:33.74]in the park that you¡¯ve suggested.
[02:35.73]M: Yes. It¡¯s a shame.
[02:38.31]But we¡¯ll wait until we can go.
[02:41.17]Q: What are the two speakers probably going to do?
[03:00.60]4. W: Do you know Jack is going to Italy next year?
[03:04.87]His wealthy aunt has left all her property there for him to heir.
[03:09.56]M: What a lucky dog.
[03:11.29]I wish I could come into a fortune like that.
[03:14.38]Q: Why is Jack going to Italy?
[03:32.74]5. W: Hey, Tom, were you in the American literature class last week?
[03:38.82]I was hoping you could tell me
[03:40.65]the reading assignment given by Prof. Lane.
[03:43.91]M: I was hoping to ask you the same question.
[03:47.79]Q: What can we learn about the speakers?
[04:05.74]6. W: Do you have any idea what you want to do
[04:09.46]when you finish your study here in the university?
[04:13.22]M:  I¡¯m thinking about it these days.
[04:15.36]I¡¯ll consult you if I need your advice.
[04:18.43]Q: What does the man mean?
[04:35.97]7. W£ºI must go to the supermarket this afternoon.
[04:40.16]It¡¯s the last day it¡¯s open before the New Year¡¯s Day.
[04:43.71]M: Sure, we don¡¯t want to be out of food.
[04:46.48]Want a hand?
[04:48.18]Q: Why is the woman going to the supermarket?
[05:06.34]8. W: I¡¯d like to apply for the position you have advertised
[05:10.70]in the newspaper yesterday.
[05:12.79]Is it still available?
[05:14.36]M: Sure. A good command of English and computing
[05:17.40]is a must as far as the position is concerned.
[05:21.47]Q: What can we learn from the conversation?
[05:39.32]Now you'll hear the two long conversations.
[05:42.89]Conversation One
[05:45.69]W: What¡¯s your plan for the interior
[05:47.77]decoration of the house we are living in?
[05:50.42]M: What should come first?
[05:52.75]We should list the materials and tools we need to buy first.
[05:56.75]W: As far as the shopping list is concerned,
[05:59.60]I think we can get everything we need
[06:01.74]to fix up the house in one trip.
[06:04.35]Then it won¡¯t bother us to purchase again.
[06:07.02]What do you think?
[06:08.30]M: We can try.
[06:09.53]It seems like everybody had the same thought
[06:12.17]when they woke up this morning: go to the home improvement store!
[06:16.79]W: Yeah, it will be a little bit crowded,
[06:19.21]but I still think we can get all we need today.
[06:22.63]M: In order to do that,
[06:24.14]I think we need to split up.
[06:26.35]Let¡¯s look at our list and divide it up.
[06:29.27]W: Okay, we need to get some wiring to install the new lights.
[06:34.67]I¡¯ll go to the electrical department for that.
[06:37.24]M: All right.
[06:38.39]We need wood for the new fence,
[06:40.36]so I¡¯ll go to the building materials department.
[06:43.49]W: What about the pipes and fixtures we need for the bathroom?
[06:47.34]Can you go to the piping department for those,
[06:50.32]while I go to the hardware department for the tools?
[06:53.54]M: Okay, I can do that,
[06:55.28]but aren¡¯t you feeling tired already?
[06:57.70]I know I am.
[06:59.19]Don¡¯t you think we should have a rest after doing those?
[07:03.09]W: Come on.
[07:03.92]How are we supposed to be weekend fighters
[07:06.43]if we can¡¯t even do some simple shopping?
[07:09.51]We¡¯ll meet in the garden department afterwards,
[07:12.20]Okay?
[07:13.49]M: Whatever you say.
[07:14.80]W: Ready, set, go!
[07:19.29]Questions 9 to 12 are based on the conversation
[07:22.40]you have just heard.
[07:26.76]9. What should the two speakers do first?
[07:46.33]10. What do they hope to do today?
[08:05.25]11. What do we know about their shopping plan?
[08:25.78]12. What is the man¡¯s attitude towards
[08:29.57]the woman¡¯s arrangement?
[08:46.76]Conversation Two
[08:50.22]W: Wow, it¡¯s freezing in here!
[08:52.92]Why is the air conditioner still on?
[08:55.42]What¡¯s the matter?
[08:56.69]M:  I turned it on just now.
[08:58.75]I just finished my morning exercising as usual
[09:02.22]and I¡¯m sweating like a pig.
[09:04.60]W: That¡¯s no reason to turn the air conditioner
[09:07.64]on full blast! I¡¯m cold.
[09:10.10]I¡¯m turning on the heat for a little while.
[09:12.85]Otherwise, I cannot finish doing the housework
[09:15.90]before going to work.
[09:17.52]M: Are you crazy?
[09:19.16]It¡¯s 70¨H outside!
[09:22.09]W: I¡¯m no crazier than you are.
[09:24.33]How come you can turn on the air conditioner and
[09:27.16]I can¡¯t turn on the heat?
[09:29.16]M: I only turned on the air conditioner
[09:31.73]because it¡¯s so humid outside,
[09:33.83]and it was taking a long time for me to cool down.
[09:37.48]If you¡¯re cold,
[09:38.72]we should just open the windows and doors,
[09:41.41]and we¡¯ll get some fresh air in here.
[09:44.00]It¡¯ll heat up again pretty quickly.
[09:47.39]W: What should I do in the meantime?
[09:49.30]Put on my winter coat or crawl under the covers?
[09:52.95]M: No need to do that.
[09:54.47]Calm down.
[09:55.44]Just go sit outside and wait.
[09:58.05]I¡¯ll do something to make both of us comfortable.
[10:00.68]I¡¯ll get myself a glass of iced tea
[10:03.27]and I¡¯ll get you a cup of hot tea.
[10:05.77]How does that sound?
[10:07.39]W: 	That sounds OK.
[10:09.03]Leave it to you to come up with the best idea of the day!
[10:13.22]What about the housework?
[10:15.05]M: Take it easy.
[10:16.61]We¡¯ll do it together as we newly got married!
[10:22.21]Questions 13 to 15 are based on the conversation
[10:25.79]you have just heard.
[10:29.96]13. Why is the man feeling so hot in the morning?
[10:50.70]14. What¡¯s the weather like today?
[11:09.87]15. What will the man do for the woman?
[11:29.92]Section B
[11:31.13]Directions: In this section,
[11:33.47]you will hear 3 short passages.
[11:36.56]At the end of each passage,
[11:38.63]you will hear some questions.
[11:40.63]Both the passage and the questions
[11:42.73]will be spoken only once.
[11:44.95]After you hear a question,
[11:46.88]you must choose the best answer
[11:48.91]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[11:54.02]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[11:58.10]with a single line through the centre.
[12:01.88]Passage One
[12:04.18]Sixty parents of youth athletes,
[12:06.23]aged 6 to 13,
[12:08.18]were interviewed in Minneapolis and its suburbs.
[12:11.57]It was found that parents brought post-game snacks
[12:15.06]for the team.
[12:16.37]The snacks typically included such items as candy,
[12:20.12]ice cream, pizza, cheese, chips.
[12:23.48]It was also quite normal for the parents
[12:26.51]to stop at fast-food restaurants like McDonald¡¯s
[12:29.99]and Dairy Queen or grab a hot dog
[12:32.70]and a sugary sports drink at the snack bar during a meet.
[12:37.08]For growing teenagers,
[12:38.99]a big meal after a tough game or race
[12:41.49]is necessary to supplement the body.
[12:44.73]And since they burn a lot of calories,
[12:47.60]they also need a fair amount of fat and protein.
[12:51.46]An active teenage boy requires about 3 000 calories a day
[12:57.14]and an active teenage girl about 2 400 calories.
[13:02.31]Younger children require anywhere
[13:04.42]from 600 to 1 000 calories a day.
[13:08.22]Problems can arise,
[13:10.10]though, when young athletes are taking
[13:12.34]in calories after games.
[13:14.68]Very young athletes may be particularly prone to excess intake.
[13:20.27]Actually, they don¡¯t exercise as much,
[13:23.51]and they don¡¯t grow as much,
[13:26.09]they don¡¯t need to be eating every two hours.
[13:28.88]The calories they take in are much more
[13:32.07]than they burn and do no good to their body.
[13:36.08]So parents are encouraged to pack healthy meals
[13:39.45]for their children so they can avoid fast food,
[13:42.80]and to leave fruit out and readily available in the kitchen.
[13:47.24]Schools and sports teams should also provide
[13:50.23]and encourage healthier options,
[13:53.09]including whole grains and nuts
[13:55.75]and other healthy protein sources,
[13:58.63]like lean meats and seafood.
[14:03.48]Questions 16 to 19 are based on the passage
[14:07.06]you have just heard.
[14:11.13]16. What do we know about the parents of youth athletes?
[14:32.21]17. What do we know about the calorie intake of children?
[14:52.84]18. What problem may arise if young athletes
[14:57.29]take in too much calories after games?
[15:16.09]19. What is the suggestion given by the speaker
[15:20.07]about teenagers?
[15:37.80]Passage Two
[15:39.50]About 5 000 years ago,
[15:41.79]the Egyptians and other people in the Near East
[15:44.93]began to use pictures as a kind of writing.
[15:47.81]They drew simple pictures or signs
[15:50.35]to represent things and ideas,
[15:52.89]and also to represent the sounds of their language.
[15:56.58]The signs these people used became a kind of alphabet.
[16:01.41]The Egyptians used to record information and
[16:05.09]to tell stories by putting picture writing and pictures together.
[16:09.64]When an important person died,
[16:12.36]scenes and stories from his life were painted
[16:15.48]on the walls of the place where he was buried.
[16:18.52]Some of these pictures are like modern comic strip stories.
[16:22.93]It has been said that Egypt is the home of the comic strip.
[16:27.10]But, for the Egyptians,
[16:29.28]pictures still had magic power.
[16:31.92]So they did not try to make their way of writing simple.
[16:36.00]The ordinary people could not understand it.
[16:39.62]By the year 1000 BC,
[16:42.48]people who lived in the area around the Mediterranean Sea
[16:46.47]had developed a simpler system of writing.
[16:50.33]The signs they used were very easy to write,
[16:53.68]and there were fewer of them than in the Egyptian system.
[16:57.76]This was because each sign, or letter,
[17:00.49]represented only one sound in their language.
[17:03.97]The Greeks developed this system and formed
[17:06.73]the letters of the Greek alphabet.
[17:09.10]The Romans copied the idea,
[17:11.58]and the Roman alphabet is now used all over the world.
[17:16.13]These days, we can write down a story,
[17:19.54]or record information,
[17:21.28]without using pictures.
[17:23.37]But we still need pictures of all kinds: drawing,
[17:27.57]photographs, signs and diagrams.
[17:30.22]Pictures help us to understand and remember things more easily,
[17:35.32]and they can make a story much more interesting.
[17:40.81]Questions 20 to 22 are based on the passage
[17:45.41]you have just heard.
[17:49.28]20. What did the Egyptians draw simple pictures for?
[18:09.40]21. What do we know about Egyptians¡¯ way of writing?
[18:29.90]22. Which alphabet is used worldwide?














[18:50.06]Passage Three
[18:52.03]Human beings have used tools for a very long time. 
[18:56.13]In some parts of the world you can still 
[18:58.59]find tools that people used more than two million years ago. 
[19:03.40]They made these tools by hitting one stone against another. 
[19:07.47]In this way,
[19:08.75]they broke off pieces from one of the stones. 
[19:11.98]These chips of stone were usually sharp on one side. 
[19:16.31]People used them for cutting meat and skin from dead animals,
[19:20.58]and also for making other tools out of wood. 
[19:24.60]Tools helped people to get food more easily. 
[19:28.67]Working with tools also helped to develop human intelligence. 
[19:33.47]The human brain grew bigger,
[19:35.41]and human beings began to invent more 
[19:38.15]and more tools and machines. 
[19:40.87]The stone chip was one of the first tools that people used. 
[19:45.32]Some scientists say that it is the key to success of mankind. 
[19:50.63]Since 1960,
[19:53.05]a new kind of tool has appeared. 
[19:55.39]That is, the silicon chip¡ªa little chip of silicon crystal. 
[20:00.30]It is smaller than a fingernail,
[20:02.88]but it can store more than a million ¡°bits¡± of information. 
[20:07.49]It is an electronic brain. 
[20:10.08]Every year these chips get cleverer,
[20:12.84]but their size gets smaller,
[20:15.51]and their cost gets less. 
[20:18.04]They are used in watches,
[20:20.02]calculators and intelligent machines 
[20:22.54]that we can use in many ways. 
[20:24.99]In the future we will not need to 
[20:27.87]work with tools in the old way. 
[20:30.61]Human beings used stone chips 
[20:33.03]for more than two million years,
[20:35.24]but human life changed very little in that time. 
[20:39.21]We have used silicon chips for only a few years,
[20:43.49]but life is changing faster every day.
[20:49.66]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage
[20:53.42]you have just heard.
[20:56.39]23. How did early human beings make tools 
[21:01.89]two million years ago?
[21:19.23]24. Why is the stone chip thought to 
[21:23.87]be an important tool?
[21:40.47]25. What is the future like according 
[21:44.68]to the speaker?


[22:02.05]Section C
[22:03.36]Directions: In this section,
[22:05.92]you will hear a passage three times.
[22:09.14]When the passage is read for the first time,
[22:12.17]you should listen carefully for its general idea.
[22:15.75]When the passage is read for the second time,
[22:18.59]you are required to fill in the blanks
[22:21.46]with the exact words you have just heard.
[22:24.02]Finally, when the passage is read for the third time,
[22:27.76]you should check what you have written.
[22:31.21]Now listen to the passage.

[27:02.56][24:48.31][22:34.49]Accomplished teachers of world languages 
[27:05.26][24:50.93][22:37.02]are keenly aware that young people learn in various ways. 
[27:09.37][24:55.04][22:41.26]They use their knowledge of child 
[27:11.33][24:57.15][22:43.36]in designing and providing appropriate instruction 
[27:14.71][25:00.31][22:46.43]to their students. 
[27:16.46][25:02.21][22:48.04]They recognize and make professional accommodations 
[27:19.48][25:05.02][22:51.08]for variations in students¡¯ age levels,
[27:22.65][25:08.55][22:54.63]cognitive, physical, and motor development,
[27:26.09][25:11.83][22:57.96]gender, multiple intelligences,
[27:28.47][25:14.17][23:00.37]and learning styles. 
[27:31.05][25:16.52][23:02.61]Attitude also plays an important role 
[27:33.77][25:19.38][23:05.75]in student success. 
[27:35.77][25:21.33][23:07.62]Students with low self-esteem or little confidence 
[27:39.01][25:24.80][23:10.80]about their ability to learn another language 
[27:41.83][25:27.50][23:13.61]might benefit from extra encouragement from the teacher. 
[27:46.01][25:31.66][23:17.79]Of course, all students can benefit 
[27:49.09][25:35.00][23:20.81]from positive teacher feedback. 
[27:51.43][25:37.16][23:23.23]Teachers might have students work in groups 
[27:54.29][25:39.68][23:25.83]so that they can also benefit from the help 
[27:57.51][25:42.68][23:28.80]and positive reinforcement of their peers. 
[28:00.71][25:45.98][23:32.42]Students who are motivated and confident 
[28:03.54][25:49.10][23:35.29]might work well independently,
[28:05.93][25:51.59][23:37.79]using computer software. 
[28:08.18][25:53.85][23:39.96]Those who teach young children know 
[28:10.96][25:56.43][23:42.59]the importance of working at concrete levels; 
[28:14.32][25:59.54][23:45.65]students might learn to tell time 
[28:16.48][26:01.78][23:48.14]as they manipulate individual student clocks,
[28:19.99][26:05.53][23:51.64]or learn children¡¯s songs while using hand 
[28:23.69][26:09.04][23:55.23]and body movements. 
[28:25.14][26:10.87][23:57.08]As for mature students,
[28:27.09][26:12.62][23:59.00]teachers need to provide more abstract 
[28:29.81][26:15.05][24:01.62]and analytical challenges. 
[28:31.96][26:17.45][24:03.71]Teachers should be aware 
[28:33.28][26:19.55][24:05.17]that personalizing the language experience 
[28:36.18][26:21.83][24:08.01]is helpful to students because many students 
[28:39.95][26:25.43][24:11.52]will talk readily about themselves and their experiences. 
[28:44.66][26:30.26][24:16.38]Teachers recognize 
[28:46.22][26:32.05][24:18.02]that providing learning experiences 
[28:48.34][26:33.96][24:20.11]in the affective field
