[00:18.13]Model Test Ten
[00:21.35]Section A
[00:22.77]Directions: In this section,
[00:26.08]you will hear 8 short conversations
[00:28.61]and 2 long conversations.
[00:31.60]At the end of each conversation,
[00:34.32]one or more questions will be asked
[00:36.76]about what was said.
[00:38.60]Both the conversation and the questions
[00:41.40]will be spoken only once.
[00:44.13]After each question there will be a pause.
[00:47.16]During the pause,
[00:48.77]you must read the four choices
[00:51.28]marked A), B), C) and D),
[00:55.13]and decide which is the best answer.
[00:58.60]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[01:02.86]with a single line through the centre.
[01:06.35]Now let¡¯s begin with the eight short conversations.
[01:12.75]1.  W: Are you going to study abroad
[01:15.90]after you finish your study at the university?
[01:19.25]M: I have changed my mind about that.
[01:22.07]I think there is more opportunity for me here
[01:24.44]and I want to start a company of my own.
[01:28.13]Q: What does the man mean?
[01:45.44]2.  W: I am totally exhausted.
[01:48.89]I stayed up the whole night studying for the final examination.
[01:53.44]M: What have you done during your previous study time?
[01:57.01]Q: What does the man imply?
[02:14.37]3. M: The subway is running behind schedule,
[02:18.39]and traffic is backing up for blocks.
[02:20.86]I don¡¯t know if we¡¯ll make the 7:15 show.
[02:24.27]W: It¡¯s a beautiful night.
[02:25.92]Let¡¯s try to get there on foot.
[02:28.07]We may have dinner near the theatre.
[02:30.88]Q: Where are they heading for?
[02:48.80]4. M: Andrew likes his new house.
[02:52.29]But he can not stop complaining about the noise.
[02:55.46]W: What does he expect?
[02:57.53]He shouldn't have chosen the house
[02:59.20]with the supermarket downstairs.
[03:01.72]Q: What does the woman mean?
[03:19.54]5. W: Hi, Alice, fancy meeting you here!
[03:24.15]M: Yeah. It has been three years
[03:26.13]since we graduated from the college,
[03:28.54]but you look almost the same as years before.
[03:31.84]Any new information about the others?
[03:34.34]Q: What do we know about the speakers?
[03:52.87]6. W: Have you finished the assignments of Prof. Li¡¯s
[03:57.61]last class?
[03:59.07]M: As soon as I went back home,
[04:01.14]that idea evaporated from my memory.
[04:04.33]I only hope Prof. Li would forget that thing.
[04:08.25]Q: What does the man probably mean?
[04:25.97]7. M: I found a wallet on my way to the library,
[04:29.77]and I do not know how to handle it.
[04:32.74]W: If I were you,
[04:33.83]I¡¯d check whether there are hints about the owner in the wallet.
[04:37.67]If there is no hint,
[04:39.32]I¡¯d turn it in to the security office of our school.
[04:43.21]Q: What¡¯s the woman¡¯s suggestion for the man?
[05:01.67]8. M: The winter does come today, I think.
[05:06.80]W: Sure it does.
[05:08.08]It is reported that the temperature goes 15 degrees below zero.
[05:12.78]And my fingers got totally numb.
[05:15.93]What shall I do with them?
[05:18.89]Q: What is the woman most probably going to do?
[05:37.30]Now you'll hear the two long conversations.
[05:40.80]Conversation One
[05:44.32]W:  What are you reading now?
[05:45.84]M: I¡¯m looking at this beauty in the picture.
[05:49.02]Look! She¡¯s really pretty, isn¡¯t she?
[05:51.88]Her skin looks so baby smooth!
[05:55.06]W:  Well, it¡¯s just that she puts lots of make-up on her face.
[05:59.05]Actually, natural beauty comes from within.
[06:02.62]And you know nowadays the camera work is so artificial.
[06:06.70]M: Ah, yeah, I can smell jealousy in the air!
[06:10.72]W: Oh, no. She has nothing that deserves my jealousy.
[06:15.09]I don¡¯t have to put things on my face and I still look pretty.
[06:19.13]Don¡¯t you think so?
[06:20.44]M: Yeah, right! But what did you put on your face last night,
[06:24.96]those little greenish things?
[06:26.90]W: They¡¯re cucumbers.
[06:28.46]M: What? I know that cucumber is a kind of vegetable
[06:32.16]rich in vitamin A.
[06:33.69]How is it used on the skincare?
[06:36.19]W: Well, it is a fashion nowadays that women tend
[06:40.08]to use the natural vegetables on the skincare.
[06:43.34]And they are much better than any chemical products.
[06:46.97]M: Really? Then what does the cucumber do for you?
[06:50.74]W: They¡¯re natural skin smoothers,
[06:53.70]natural healers of the skin.
[06:56.01]Haven¡¯t you heard them say on TV that...er...
[06:59.51]cucumber goes far beyond mere tightening the skin?
[07:02.66]In fact, cucumbers have been used
[07:05.46]as a dry skin remedy for centuries,
[07:07.94]and they are also effective
[07:10.26]in the treatment of other skin problems.
[07:12.35]M: I have got a scar on my cheek.
[07:14.89]Can the cucumber do something about it?
[07:17.50]W: Try some herbal plants,
[07:19.69]which have the function of remedying the scarred skin.
[07:23.12]M: It sounds reasonable.
[07:24.82]Actually there is much knowledge needed for the skincare.
[07:30.81]Questions 9 to 12 are based on the conversation
[07:34.29]you have just heard.
[07:38.66]9. What does the woman feel about the beauty in the picture?
[07:59.02]10. What do women tend to do nowadays
[08:03.44]to care their skins?
[08:19.58]11. What is the skincare function of cucumbers according to the woman?
[08:40.76]12. What does the woman suggest the man
[08:44.83]do with the scar on his cheek?
[09:02.50]Conversation Two
[09:05.00]W: What a terrific drawing,
[09:06.88]Mark! I didn¡¯t know you could paint.
[09:09.39]M: Well. I¡¯m just learning.
[09:11.43]It¡¯s one piece of work for my oil painting class.
[09:14.83]W: It¡¯s pretty good for a beginner.
[09:17.50]I think your teacher will definitely
[09:19.86]give this painting a full mark.
[09:22.41]M: I hope so. But you see,
[09:24.52]last time I had a dispute with my teacher.
[09:27.45]It seemed that he didn¡¯t appreciate my work at all.
[09:30.98]W: Why?
[09:31.80]M: Look here in the picture.
[09:33.68]My teacher insisted that it just needed
[09:36.08]to fill in with other colors of painting.
[09:38.77]But I think the sky should be blue.
[09:41.91]W: Well, it depends.
[09:44.09]Sometimes it is blue and sometimes it isn¡¯t,
[09:47.03]as sunset can be full reds and purples.
[09:50.31]M: It sounds reasonable.
[09:52.60]Then what kind of color should I add to it?
[09:55.67]W: How about light brown color?
[09:58.13]M: Oh, yeah.
[09:59.47]Added some light brown to the sky,
[10:02.03]it will turn out to be more natural than before.
[10:05.20]You¡¯re so great! You must have taken many painting courses before.
[10:10.45]W: Well, I haven¡¯t accepted any painting training before.
[10:14.27]But I¡¯d love to visit art museums.
[10:16.82]Each time I go abroad,
[10:18.94]the art center of the destination country
[10:21.80]is a quite necessary place for my visiting.
[10:25.02]M: Wow, then what kind of painting do you like most?
[10:29.26]Oil painting?
[10:30.61]W: Frankly speaking,
[10:32.01]I prefer using water colors.
[10:34.36]I don¡¯t like the smell of the oil paints.
[10:39.82]Questions 13 to 15 are based on the conversation
[10:43.26]you have just heard.
[10:47.21]13. What happened between Mark and his painting teacher?
[11:07.31]14. What does the woman suggest the man do about the painting?
[11:28.87]15. How did the woman learn about painting?
[11:49.82]Section B
[11:50.97]Directions: In this section,
[11:53.52]you will hear 3 short passages.
[11:56.55]At the end of each passage,
[11:58.49]you will hear some questions.
[12:00.48]Both the passage and the questions
[12:02.59]will be spoken only once.
[12:05.06]After you hear a question,
[12:06.99]you must choose the best answer
[12:09.01]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[12:14.02]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[12:18.14]with a single line through the centre.
[12:21.63]Passage One
[12:23.01]West Point is a four-year school in New York State
[12:26.55]that educates future Army officers.
[12:29.80]The students are called cadets.
[12:32.43]They do not have to pay for their educations.
[12:35.51]They must agree to serve on active duty in the Army
[12:39.05]for at least five years after they graduate.
[12:42.55]A young man or woman must be nominated to the academy,
[12:47.03]usually by a federal or state lawmaker.
[12:50.70]Nominees also must satisfy the entrance requirements.
[12:55.11]These include being in excellent physical condition
[12:58.82]and getting good grades in high school.
[13:01.76]In addition, students from other countries
[13:04.53]can also attend the academy.
[13:07.25]The international students must be nominated
[13:10.26]by their home governments.
[13:12.24]And also they must satisfy physical
[13:15.47]and educational requirements.
[13:18.18]Surely they must do well in TOEFL.
[13:21.25]Home governments may have to pay up to sixty thousand
[13:24.81]dollars a year for each student they send to West Point.
[13:29.40]Among the countries with cadets at the academy
[13:32.44]this year are Afghanistan,
[13:34.78]Bulgaria, Cameroon, Costa Rica,
[13:37.86]Iraq, Kazakhstan, Sri Lanka, and Tunisia.
[13:42.62]Each year, the United States Defense Department
[13:45.79]invites countries to nominate students to West Point
[13:49.19]and to the Navy and Air Force academies.
[13:52.60]Not all the countries take part in the program.
[13:55.95]Up to sixty foreign cadets at any time can attend the academy.
[14:00.76]And the interested students must seek information
[14:04.06]about the program at their local American Embassy.
[14:07.75]The embassy¡¯s Defense Cooperation Office
[14:10.44]will know how the students can be nominated.
[14:16.08]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage
[14:19.46]you have just heard.
[14:23.72]16. What must the cadets do after graduation from West Point?
[14:45.23]17. How could foreign students enter West Point?
[15:05.16]18. Where can the foreign students get
[15:08.63]the information of the program?
[15:26.11]Passage Two
[15:27.72]Coffee is a part of an international industry.
[15:31.09]Research shows that as many as one-third
[15:33.74]of the people in the world drink coffee.
[15:36.62]But not everyone may know the story of coffee
[15:39.80]and how it is produced.
[15:41.91]One popular story about the discovery of coffee long ago
[15:46.00]is about Kaldi, a keeper of goats.
[15:49.42]Kaldi was taking care of his goats
[15:52.07]in the highlands of Ethiopia where coffee trees
[15:55.27]had grown for centuries.
[15:57.34]He noticed that his goats became very excited
[16:01.20]and active after eating small fruits from a tree.
[16:05.21]Kaldi reported this discovery to a group
[16:08.37]of religious workers.
[16:10.47]When they made a drink out of the fruit,
[16:12.61]the religious workers realized they could stay awake
[16:15.96]for long hours of prayer.
[16:18.55]Coffee trees can grow up to nine meters high,
[16:22.27]but they are cut short for production.
[16:25.21]The plant produces a fruit that is called a coffee cherry.
[16:29.54]When the coffee cherries are ripe and ready to be picked,
[16:33.36]they are bright, red and firm.
[16:36.09]Inside the fruits are the green coffee beans.
[16:39.50]After these beans are roasted at high temperatures,
[16:43.48]they are ready to be made into a drink.
[16:46.31]There may only be two main kinds of coffee plants.
[16:50.49]But geography and climate differences
[16:53.18]have a big effect on the many different ways coffee can taste.
[16:57.49]For example, coffee grown in Ethiopia
[17:01.03]is known for its lively,
[17:02.97]sharp taste and its flowery smell.
[17:05.88]Coffee from the island of Sumatra
[17:08.59]has a full body with an earthy and intense taste.
[17:15.06]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage
[17:18.37]you have just heard.
[17:22.23]19. Who discovered coffee according to the passage?
[17:42.63]20. How is coffee made from the coffee plant
[17:46.44]according to the passage?
[18:03.90]21. Which of the following factors may
[18:07.56]influence the taste of coffee?









[18:24.96]Passage Three
[18:26.67]We¡¯ve now discussed how most snakes move,
[18:30.21]but there are some exceptions. 
[18:32.45]One is the snake called the American side-winder. 
[18:36.42]From its name,
[18:37.40]you can probably guess that it moves sideways 
[18:40.25]rather than in a straight line. 
[18:42.99]This is because it lives in the desert 
[18:45.18]where the sand slips and slides. 
[18:48.30]With nothing firm to push against,
[18:50.10]the side-winder has to adapt 
[18:52.07]its way of movement to the shifting sand. 
[18:55.44]It pushes against the sand with the entire side of its body,
[19:00.15]and then moves sideways. 
[19:02.51]Think about how a skier climbs a slope on skis. 
[19:06.31]The skier places the skis at an angle of 90 degrees 
[19:09.89]to the direction of movement. 
[19:12.13]The skier then moves each ski by taking a step 
[19:15.71]to the side up the slope. 
[19:18.24]The side-winder snake moves in much the same manner. 
[19:21.76]It lays its body at about 60-degree angle 
[19:25.22]to the direction in which it wants to go. 
[19:28.34]By doing this,
[19:29.62]the snake has more sand to push against. 
[19:32.88]Then it points its head in the direction it wants 
[19:35.69]to go and leaps to a parallel spot. 
[19:39.32]If you see the tracks left by side-winder in loose sand,
[19:43.11]you¡¯ll see a series of paralleled lines. 
[19:46.79]An advantage gained from this method of moving 
[19:50.04]may be that the snake¡¯s body is kept cooler 
[19:52.81]by breaking off contact with the hot sand during its leaps.

[19:59.74]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage
[20:03.32]you have just heard.
[20:07.56]22. What is the main topic of the passage?
[20:27.53]23. Why does the side-winder move the way it does?
[20:48.29]24. What do the side-winder¡¯s tracks look like?
[21:08.92]25. What may be a special advantage of 
[21:12.94]the side-winder¡¯s way of moving?

[21:31.31]Section C
[21:32.55]Directions: In this section,
[21:35.26]you will hear a passage three times.
[21:38.64]When the passage is read for the first time,
[21:41.40]you should listen carefully for its general idea.
[21:44.95]When the passage is read for the second time,
[21:47.86]you are required to fill in the blanks
[21:50.12]with the exact words you have just heard.
[21:53.53]Finally, when the passage is read for the third time,
[21:57.11]you should check what you have written.
[22:00.46]Now listen to the passage.


[25:57.16][23:59.35][22:03.33]More and more foreign students experience 
[25:59.45][24:01.59][22:05.52]their independent life in the quest 
[26:01.45][24:03.68][22:07.66]to gain a western education. 
[26:03.99][24:06.17][22:10.21]They are surrounded by an unfamiliar culture,
[26:07.11][24:09.50][22:13.32]environment and social norms,
[26:09.75][24:12.08][22:15.64]while being away from family and friends. 
[26:12.76][24:14.92][22:18.55]What would prospective overseas students do 
[26:15.47][24:17.38][22:21.87]in their preparations to study overseas? 
[26:19.06][24:21.50][22:25.49]Get to know your new home before you land in it. 
[26:23.23][24:25.40][22:29.20]There is no substitute for good preparation. 
[26:26.59][24:28.98][22:32.58]Arm yourself with background knowledge by researching information 
[26:30.97][24:33.04][22:36.94]about the country you are going to. 
[26:33.73][24:36.01][22:39.88]Learning about the history,
[26:35.68][24:37.74][22:41.54]culture, tradition, language and even details such as food,
[26:40.34][24:42.67][22:46.50]music, transport, weather and social activities 
[26:44.16][24:46.38][22:50.39]of your new host country is all essential. 
[26:48.15][24:50.11][22:54.13]Thanks to the Internet,
[26:49.81][24:51.96][22:55.82]most of this can be found at the click of a button. 
[26:53.26][24:55.33][22:59.34]Attitude is everything. 
[26:55.75][24:57.73][23:01.88]Don¡¯t underestimate the power of the mind 
[26:58.13][25:00.26][23:04.35]in determining how events turn out. 
[27:01.08][25:03.35][23:07.24]Decide how to approach any situation,
[27:04.38][25:06.15][23:10.34]before you are placed in it. 
[27:06.52][25:08.71][23:12.49]For example, a positive attitude toward your new home 
[27:10.77][25:12.87][23:16.78]and hosts will bring positive results. 
[27:14.14][25:16.62][23:20.51]Pack using your head and your heart. 
[27:17.34][25:19.53][23:23.62]It¡¯s not easy being practical when deciding what to pack. 
[27:21.97][25:24.30][23:28.14]Whatever you bring,
[27:23.12][25:25.64][23:29.37]make sure that will be something that 
[27:25.42][25:27.66][23:31.60]you think might help your chances of succeeding. 
[27:28.74][25:30.75][23:34.57]This includes practical items such as study materials,
[27:32.95][25:35.35][23:39.21]old class notes,
[27:34.65][25:37.03][23:40.82]favorite textbooks or pens and 
[27:37.37][25:39.70][23:43.69]even the contact details of previous teachers. 
[27:41.08][25:43.14][23:46.94]Items such as an album with photographs 
[27:43.86][25:45.88][23:49.98]of family can help you feel closer to home.
[23:55.76]Now the passage will be read again.
[25:52.74]Now the passage will be read for the third time.
[27:50.30]This is the end of listening comprehension.
