[00:17.08]Model Test Twelve
[00:20.47]Section A
[00:22.55]Directions: In this section,
[00:24.99]you will hear 8 short conversations
[00:28.01]and 2 long conversations.
[00:31.35]At the end of each conversation,
[00:33.59]one or more questions will be asked
[00:35.99]about what was said.
[00:37.73]Both the conversation and the questions
[00:40.73]will be spoken only once.
[00:43.88]After each question there will be a pause.
[00:47.31]During the pause,
[00:48.68]you must read the four choices
[00:50.66]marked A), B), C), and D),
[00:54.16]and decide which is the best answer.
[00:57.25]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[01:01.68]with a single line through the centre.
[01:04.48]Now let¡¯s begin with the eight short conversations.
[01:10.83]1. W: This crazy bus schedule
[01:14.78]has got me completely confused.
[01:17.38]I can¡¯t figure out when my bus to Cleveland leaves.
[01:21.41]M: Why don¡¯t you just go to the ticket window and ask?
[01:26.17]Q: What does the man suggest the woman do?
[01:45.15]2. W: I really enjoyed the TV special
[01:50.10]about giraffes last night.
[01:52.23]Did you get home in time to see it?
[01:54.48]M: Oh, yes, but I wish I could have
[01:56.97]stayed awake long enough to see the whole thing.
[02:01.25]Q: What does the man mean?
[02:18.92]3. W: Airport, please. I¡¯m running a little late.
[02:23.78]So just take the fastest way
[02:26.11]even if it¡¯s not the most direct.
[02:29.11]M: Sure, but there is a lot of traffic everywhere today
[02:32.97]because of the football game.
[02:36.54]Q: What do we learn about the woman
[02:38.69]from the conversation?
[02:56.26]4. W: May I make a recommendation, Sir?
[03:00.55]Our seafood with this special sauce is very good.
[03:04.89]M: Thank you, but I don¡¯t eat shellfish.
[03:08.43]I¡¯m allergic to it.
[03:11.52]Q: Where does this conversation
[03:13.32]most probably take place?
[03:31.83]5. W: Now one more question if you don¡¯t mind.
[03:37.20]What position in the company appeals to you most?
[03:40.98]M: Well, I¡¯d like the position of sales manager
[03:44.71]if that position is still vacant.
[03:47.68]Q: What do we learn about the man?
[04:06.43]6. M: I don¡¯t think I want to
[04:09.16]live in the dormitory next year.
[04:11.50]I need more privacy.
[04:14.36]W: I know what you mean.
[04:15.97]But check out the cost of renting an apartment first.
[04:20.39]I won¡¯t be surprised if you change your mind.
[04:25.16]Q: What does the woman imply?
[04:42.81]7. M: You¡¯re on the right track.
[04:46.46]I just think you need to narrow the topic down.
[04:50.20]W: Yeah, you¡¯re right.
[04:51.74]I always start by choosing too broad a topic
[04:55.78]when I¡¯m doing a research paper.
[04:59.26]Q: What do we learn from the conversation?
[05:17.00]8. W: This picnic sure beats the last one
[05:21.91]we went to, doesn¡¯t it?
[05:23.75]M: Oh, yeah. We had to spend the whole time inside.
[05:28.21]Good thing, the weather was cooperative this time.
[05:31.93]Q: What do we learn about the speakers
[05:34.06]from the conversation?
[05:51.53]Now you will hear the two long conversations.

[05:57.66]Conversation One
[06:00.05]M: When I say I live in Sweden,
[06:02.20]people always want to know about the seasons.
[06:05.60]W: The seasons?
[06:07.12]M: Yeah, you know, how cold it is in winter,
[06:10.44]what it's like when the days are so short.
[06:13.71]W: So what is it like?
[06:15.97]M: Well, it is cold, very cold in winter,
[06:19.39]sometimes as cold as 26 degrees below centigrade.
[06:24.00]And of course when you go out, you'll wrap up warm.
[06:27.71]But inside, in the houses, it¡¯s always very warm,
[06:32.43]much warmer than at home.
[06:34.70]Swedish people always complain that
[06:37.28]when they visit England,
[06:38.88]the houses are cold even in a good winter.
[06:42.53]W: And what about the darkness?
[06:45.72]M: Well, yeah, around Christmas time
[06:48.31]there¡¯s only one hour of daylight,
[06:50.90]so you really look forward to the spring.
[06:54.27]It is sometimes a bit depressing.
[06:56.90]But you see the summers are amazing.
[07:00.21]From May to July in the north of Sweden,
[07:03.29]the sun never sets. It¡¯s still light at midnight.
[07:07.67]You can walk in the mountains and read a newspaper.
[07:11.19]W: Oh, yeah, "the land of the midnight sun."
[07:15.20]M: That¡¯s right, but it¡¯s wonderful.
[07:18.31]You wantna stay up all night,
[07:20.03]and the Swedes make the most of it.
[07:22.58]Often they start work earlier in summer
[07:25.21]and then leave at about 2:00 or 3:00 in the afternoon,
[07:29.35]so that they can really enjoy the long summer evenings.
[07:33.77]They like to work hard, but play hard, too.
[07:36.98]I think Londoners work longer hours,
[07:40.02]but I¡¯m not sure this is a good thing.
[07:45.73]Questions 9 to 12 are based on the conversation
[07:49.20]you¡¯ve just heard.
[07:53.79]9. What do we learn about the man
[07:58.16]from the conversation?
[08:15.31]10. What do Swedish people complain about
[08:19.46]when they visit England in winter?
[08:37.96]11. How does the man describe
[08:42.02]the short hour of daylight around Christmas in Sweden?
[09:01.98]12. What does the man say about the Swedish people?
[09:23.97]Conversation Two
[09:26.33]W: What kind of training does one need
[09:28.60]to go into this type of job?
[09:31.19]M: That¡¯s a very good question.
[09:33.11]I don¡¯t think there is any, specifically.
[09:36.00]W: For example, in your case,
[09:39.00]what was your educational background?
[09:41.45]M: Well, I did a degree in French at Nottingham.
[09:45.35]After that, I did careers work in secondary schools
[09:48.99]like the careers guidance people here in the university.



[09:53.10]Then I went into local government because I found
[09:57.12]I was more interested in the administrative side,

[10:00.84]then progressed onto universities.
[10:03.82]So there wasn¡¯t any plan
[10:05.67]and there was no specific training.
[10:08.04]There are plenty of training courses
[10:09.92]in management techniques and committee work
[10:12.78]which you can attend now.
[10:15.76]W: But in the first place, you did a French degree.
[10:19.59]M: In my time, there wasn¡¯t a degree
[10:21.62]you could do for administration.
[10:24.27]I think most of the administrators I¡¯ve come across
[10:27.15]have degrees and all sorts of things.
[10:29.95]W: Well, I know in my case,

[10:32.78]I did an English Literature degree and I didn¡¯t really
[10:35.86]expect to end up doing what I am doing now.
[10:39.28]M: Quite.
[10:40.32]W: Were you local to Nottingham, actually?
[10:43.01]Is there any reason
[10:44.45]why you went to Nottingham University?
[10:46.90]M: No, no. I come from the north of England,
[10:50.32]from West Yorkshire.
[10:52.28]Nottingham was one of the universities I put on my list.
[10:56.03]And I like the look of it. The campus is just beautiful.
[11:00.35]W: Yes, indeed. Let¡¯s see.
[11:04.05]Were you from the industrial part of Yorkshire?
[11:07.20]M: Yes, from the woolen District.
[11:11.91]Questions 13 to 15 are based on the conversation
[11:15.46]you have just heard.
[11:19.44]13. What was the man¡¯s major at university?
[11:40.69]14. What was the man¡¯s job in secondary schools?
[12:02.20]15. What attracted the man to Nottingham University?
[12:23.51]Section B
[12:25.00]Directions: In this section,
[12:27.65]you will hear 3 short passages.
[12:31.11]At the end of each passage,
[12:33.38]you will hear some questions.
[12:35.51]Both the passage and the questions
[12:37.19]will be spoken only once.
[12:40.34]After you hear a question,
[12:41.87]you must choose the best answer
[12:44.07]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[12:49.49]Then mark the corresponding letter
[12:51.88]on Answer Sheet 1
[12:53.75]with a single line through the centre.
[12:57.36]Passage One
[12:59.15]While Gail Obcamp, an American artist,
[13:02.23]was giving a speech on the art
[13:04.04]of Japanese brush painting
[13:05.84]to an audience that included visitors from Japan,
[13:09.68]she was confused to see that
[13:11.33]many of her Japanese listeners had their eyes closed.
[13:15.47]Were they tuned off because an American had the nerve
[13:18.84]to instruct Japanese in their own art form
[13:22.40]or they deliberately tried to signal their rejection of her?



[13:27.19]Obcamp later found out that
[13:29.37]her listeners were not being disrespectful.
[13:32.61]Japanese listeners sometimes close their eyes
[13:35.61]to enhance concentration.
[13:37.83]Her listeners were showing their respect for her
[13:40.57]by chewing on her words.
[13:43.37]Some day you may be either a speaker or a listener


[13:46.75]in a situation involving people from other countries
[13:50.59]or members of a minority group in North America.
[13:54.38]Learning how different cultures signal respect
[13:57.33]can help you avoid misunderstandings.
[14:00.89]Here are some examples.
[14:03.12]In the deaf culture of North America,
[14:05.50]many listeners show applause
[14:07.54]not by clapping their hands
[14:09.80]but by waving them in the air.
[14:12.44]In some cultures, both overseas
[14:14.55]and in some minority groups in North America,
[14:17.80]listeners are considered disrespectful
[14:20.85]if they look directly at the speaker.
[14:24.19]Respect is shown by looking in the general direction
[14:27.12]but avoiding direct eye contact. In some countries,
[14:31.66]whistling by listeners is a sign of approval
[14:35.05]while in other countries it is a form of insult.
[14:40.30]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage
[14:44.07]you have just heard.
[14:47.53]16. What did Obcamp¡¯s speech focus on?
[15:09.29]17. Why do Japanese listeners sometimes
[15:14.64]close their eyes while listening to a speech?
[15:33.22]18. What does the speaker try to explain?
[15:54.92]Passage Two
[15:56.88]Chris is in charge of purchasing
[15:58.64]and maintaining equipment
[16:00.49]in his division at Tax Along Company.
[16:04.13]He is soon going to have an evaluation interview
[16:07.67]with his supervisor and the personnel director
[16:10.94]to discuss the work he has done in the past year.
[16:14.56]Salary, promotion and plans for the coming year
[16:17.73]will also be discussed at the meeting.
[16:20.84]Chris has made several changes
[16:22.48]for his division in the past year.
[16:25.23]First, he bought new equipment
[16:27.14]for one of the departments.
[16:29.24]He has been particularly happy
[16:31.15]about the new equipment
[16:33.09]because many of the employees have told him
[16:35.63]how much it has helped them.
[16:38.01]Along with improving the equipment,
[16:40.17]Chris began a program to train employees
[16:43.47]to use equipment better
[16:45.38]and do simple maintenance themselves.
[16:48.21]The training saved time for the employees
[16:51.01]and money for the company. Unfortunately,
[16:54.25]one serious problem developed during the year.
[16:58.29]Two employees that Chris hired were stealing,
[17:01.25]and he had to fire them.
[17:03.19]Chris knows that a new job for a purchasing
[17:06.14]and maintenance manager for the whole company
[17:09.03]will be open in a few months,
[17:11.47]and he would like to be promoted to the job.
[17:14.55]Chris knows, however,
[17:15.71]that someone else wants the new job, too.
[17:18.75]Kim is in charge of purchasing and maintenance
[17:21.57]in another division of the company.
[17:24.21]She has also made several changes over the year.
[17:27.46]Chris knows that his boss likes Kim¡¯s work,
[17:30.98]and he expects that his work
[17:33.05]will be compared with hers.
[17:36.72]Questions 19 to 22 are based on the passage
[17:40.89]you have just heard.
[17:45.10]19. What is Chris¡¯s main responsibility
[17:50.14]at Tax Along Company?
[18:07.49]20. What problem did Chris encounter in his division?
[18:28.40]21. What does Chris hope for in the near future?
[18:49.55]22. What do we learn about Kim from the passage?
[19:10.64]Passage Three
[19:12.69]Proverbs, sometimes called sayings,
[19:15.74]are examples of folk wisdom.
[19:18.74]They are little lessons which older people of a culture
[19:21.75]pass down to the younger people to teach them about life.


[19:26.61]Many proverbs remind people of the values
[19:29.36]that are important in the culture.
[19:31.96]Values teach people how to act,
[19:34.45]what is right, and what is wrong.
[19:37.34]Because the values of each culture are different,
[19:40.70]understanding the values of another culture
[19:43.58]helps explain how people think and act.
[19:47.78]Understanding your own culture values is important too.
[19:52.05]If you can accept that people from other cultures
[19:55.04]act according to their values, not yours,
[19:58.75]getting along with them will be much easier.
[20:02.03]Many proverbs are very old.
[20:04.75]So some of the values they teach may not be
[20:07.35]as important in the culture as they once were.
[20:11.05]For example, Americans today do not
[20:13.85]pay much attention to the proverb ¡°Haste makes waste,¡±
[20:18.15]because patience is not important to them.
[20:21.87]But if you know about past values,
[20:24.39]it helps you to understand the present.
[20:27.04]And many of the older values are still strong today.
[20:31.09]Benjamin Franklin, a famous American diplomat,
[20:34.66]writer and scientist, died in 1790,
[20:38.82]but his proverb ¡°Time is money¡± is taken more seriously
[20:43.25]by Americans of today than ever before.
[20:46.74]A study of proverbs from around the world
[20:49.02]shows that some values are shared by many cultures.
[20:53.56]In many cases though,
[20:55.21]the same idea is expressed differently.
[21:00.67]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage
[21:04.76]you have just heard.
[21:09.27]23. Why are proverbs so important?
[21:29.77]24. According to the speaker,
[21:33.69]what happens to some proverbs
[21:35.55]with the passage of time?
[21:53.17]25. What do we learn from the study of proverbs
[21:58.09]from around the world?


[22:15.91]Section C
[22:17.59]Directions: In this section,
[22:20.17]you will hear a passage three times.
[22:23.52]When the passage is read for the first time,
[22:26.35]you should listen carefully for its general idea.
[22:30.05]When the passage is read for the second time,
[22:32.81]you are required to fill in the blanks
[22:35.57]with the exact words you have just heard.
[22:39.17]Finally, when the passage is read for the third time,
[22:42.87]you should check what you have written.
[22:45.73]Now listen to the passage.


[26:12.73][24:31.11][22:48.77]Our lives are woven together.
[26:15.63][24:34.01][22:51.57]As much as I enjoy my own company,
[26:18.37][24:36.52][22:54.23]I no longer imagine I can get through a single day,
[26:21.61][24:39.97][22:57.60]much less all my life, completely on my own.
[26:25.58][24:43.80][23:01.46]Even if I am on vacation in the mountains,
[26:28.56][24:46.87][23:04.51]I am eating food someone else has grown,
[26:31.85][24:50.29][23:07.82]living in a house someone else has built,
[26:35.16][24:53.55][23:11.04]wearing clothes someone else has sewn from cloth
[26:38.88][24:57.08][23:14.58]woven by others, using electricity
[26:41.96][25:00.38][23:17.90]someone else is distributing to my house.
[26:45.20][25:03.95][23:21.46]Evidence of interdependence is everywhere.
[26:49.00][25:07.28][23:24.99]We are on this journey together.
[26:52.10][25:10.42][23:27.72]As I was growing up,
[26:53.69][25:12.02][23:29.62]I remember being carefully taught that independence,
[26:56.90][25:15.21][23:32.91]not interdependence was everything.
[26:59.85][25:18.22][23:36.22]¡°Make your own way,¡± ¡°Stand on your own two feet,¡±
[27:04.16][25:22.54][23:40.38]or my mother¡¯s favorite remark
[27:06.18][25:24.71][23:42.19]when I was face-to-face with
[27:07.96][25:26.40][23:44.18]consequences of some action:
[27:10.29][25:28.71][23:46.39]¡°Now that you¡¯ve made your bed, lie on it!¡±
[27:13.95][25:32.34][23:50.00]Total independence is a dominant theme in our culture.
[27:18.14][25:36.42][23:54.13]I imagine that what my parents were trying to teach me
[27:21.39][25:39.77][23:57.30]was to take responsibility for my actions and my choices.
[27:25.94][25:44.65][24:02.05]But the teaching was shaped by our cultural images,
[27:30.30][25:48.62][24:06.19]and instead I grew up believing that
[27:33.17][25:51.45][24:08.99]I was supposed to be totally ¡°independent¡±
[27:35.97][25:54.20][24:12.22]and consequently became very reluctant to ask for help.
[27:40.77][25:59.49][24:17.18]I would do almost anything not to be a burden,
[27:44.36][26:03.05][24:20.80]and not require any help from anybody.
[24:26.68]Now the passage will be read again.

[26:07.91]Now the passage will be read for the third time.

[27:49.86]This is the end of listening comprehension.
