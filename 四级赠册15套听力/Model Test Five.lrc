[00:16.47]Model Test Five
[00:18.93]Section A
[00:20.24]Directions: In this section, 
[00:22.66]you will hear 8 short conversations 
[00:25.14]and 2 long conversations. 
[00:27.97]At the end of each conversation, 
[00:30.90]one or more questions will be asked 
[00:33.30]about what was said. 
[00:35.10]Both the conversation and the questions 
[00:38.49]will be spoken only once. 
[00:41.21]After each question there will be a pause. 
[00:44.48]During the pause, 
[00:46.01]you must read the four choices 
[00:48.44]marked A), B), C) and D), 
[00:51.76]and decide which is the best answer. 
[00:55.05]Then mark the corresponding letter 
[00:57.83]on Answer Sheet 1 
[00:59.51]with a single line through the centre. 
[01:02.63]Now let¡¯s begin with the eight short conversations.
[01:07.60]1. M: I just stopped by your office in the bank. 
[01:12.11]They told me that you had quit. 
[01:13.99]Where are you working now? 
[01:15.52]W: I am working for a lawyer now. 
[01:18.51]The pay is better 
[01:19.90]and the work is much more interesting. 
[01:23.15]Q: Where did the woman work before?
[01:40.11]2. W: Would you stop the car 
[01:44.11]so we can have a drink?
[01:45.99]M: I¡¯d love to, 
[01:47.10]but we have got to continue driving 
[01:49.82]so that we can get to Big King Hotel before dark.
[01:54.07]Q: What does the man want to do?
[02:11.79]3. M: Do you know 
[02:13.81]how I can get to the research lab from here?
[02:17.20]W: Walking from here is out of the question, 
[02:19.96]and the last bus has already gone. 
[02:22.83]Do you have a car?
[02:24.77]Q: What does the woman imply?
[02:41.18]4. W: There¡¯ll be a meeting 
[02:44.55]for the handicapped next week. 
[02:46.78]They decided that 
[02:48.00]every participant should wear a uniform.
[02:51.19]M: Yeah. I¡¯m the right man for the design job.
[02:54.94]Q: What is the man going to do?
[03:12.56]5. W: Can you believe the cost of the textbooks! 
[03:17.29]I just paid ¡ç55 for my chemistry books!
[03:21.59]M: That¡¯s nothing. 
[03:23.01]Just think twice before you decide 
[03:25.54]to take an art history class.
[03:27.83]Q: What does the man imply?
[03:44.56]6. W: It¡¯s really hard 
[03:47.59]to concentrate with that noisy background. 
[03:50.58]Do you know where it¡¯s coming from?
[03:52.95]M: Yeah, it¡¯s the printer. 
[03:54.85]But don¡¯t worry. 
[03:56.07]It only does that when it¡¯s warming up.
[03:58.85]Q: What can be inferred from the conversation?
[04:17.47]7. M: I¡¯ve heard a rumor 
[04:19.80]that we¡¯re going to have a quiz in class tomorrow.
[04:22.96]W: That¡¯s definitely news to me.
[04:25.51]Q: What does the woman mean?
[04:42.08]8. W: I appreciate your professional opinion. 
[04:46.71]Do you think I should invest in the project?
[04:49.89]M: Under no circumstances should you do that.
[04:53.12]Q: What advice does the man give to the woman?
[05:11.50]Now you¡¯ll hear the two long conversations
[05:15.75]Conversation One
[05:17.69]M: English Language Center. 
[05:19.37]May I help you?
[05:20.46]W: Yes. I¡¯m calling to find out more information 
[05:23.49]about your program. 
[05:24.96]For example, what kind of courses do you offer?
[05:28.36]M: Well, first of all, the purpose of our program 
[05:32.11]is to provide language learning opportunities 
[05:35.36]to this area¡¯s community, 
[05:37.33]whether a student¡¯s goal is 
[05:39.21]to master basic functional language skills, 
[05:42.39]let¡¯s say, for his or her job, 
[05:44.73]or to study intensively 
[05:46.69]to enter a US college or university.
[05:49.92]W: OK. I¡¯m calling for a friend 
[05:52.27]who is interested in attending a US university.
[05:55.91]M: And that¡¯s the kind of, uh, instruction that we provide, 
[06:00.44]from basic communication courses to content-based classes 
[06:05.49]such as computer literacy, intercultural communication, 
[06:09.31]and business English.
[06:10.72]W: Great. What is your application deadline 
[06:13.60]for the next semester?
[06:15.37]M: Well, we ask applicants 
[06:17.43]to apply no later than two months 
[06:20.13]before the semester begins. 
[06:22.27]This gives us time to process the application 
[06:25.59]and issue the students¡¯ I-20.
[06:28.48]W: I-20?
[06:29.74]M: Oh, an I-20 is a form that indicates 
[06:33.60]that we are giving permission for the student 
[06:36.46]to study in our program, 
[06:38.30]and then the student takes this form to the US embassy 
[06:42.31]in his or her home country 
[06:45.04]to apply for the F-1 student visa.
[06:47.77]W: Alright. What is the tuition for a full-time student?
[06:51.69]M: It¡¯s ¡ç2 030.
[06:54.84]W: And how can I apply?
[06:56.67]M: Well, we can send you an application 
[06:59.43]and you can mail it back to us, 
[07:01.45]or you can fill out our application 
[07:04.20]that¡¯s on our website.
[07:07.74]Questions 9 to 11 are based on the conversation 
[07:12.27]you have just heard.
[07:15.37]9. Which is one of the purposes 
[07:18.79]of the English Language Center?
[07:36.77]10. What do we learn about the program 
[07:40.44]from this conversation?
[07:57.62]11. If the fall semester begins on August 29, 
[08:02.74]by what date should one apply for the program?
[08:21.18]Conversation Two
[08:23.00]M: So, Susan, do you have anything planned 
[08:25.96]for this Saturday?
[08:27.40]W: I¡¯m kind of busy. 
[08:28.96]Why do you ask?
[08:30.22]M: I was wondering if you¡¯d like 
[08:32.67]to get together and do something, 
[08:34.61]like watching a movie 
[08:36.53]or taking a walk down by the lake.
[08:39.34]W: I¡¯d love to, 
[08:40.30]but I¡¯m really going to be busy 
[08:42.04]all day on Saturday.
[08:43.70]M: What do you have to do 
[08:45.21]on that day?
[08:46.13]W: First, I have to help my mom clean the house 
[08:49.30]in the morning, 
[08:50.27]and then I have a dentist appointment at 12:30. 
[08:53.97]I can¡¯t miss that 
[08:55.41]because I¡¯ve canceled twice before.
[08:57.91]M: What about hanging out after that?
[09:01.07]W: Well, I¡¯m going to be running around all day. 
[09:04.16]After the dentist appointment,
[09:06.27]I need to meet Julie at 2:00 
[09:09.21]to help her with her science project 
[09:11.52]that¡¯s due on Monday morning at school.
[09:14.02]M: OK. But are you free after that?
[09:16.83]W: Hardly. Then I have to pick my brother up 
[09:19.96]from soccer practice at 4:30, 
[09:22.35]and cook dinner for the family at 5:30. 
[09:25.63]I feel like a slave sometimes.
[09:28.33]M: Wow, sounds like you¡¯re going to 
[09:31.37]have a full day. 
[09:32.99]Why don¡¯t I come over later in the evening, 
[09:36.02]and we can make some popcorn 
[09:37.83]and watch a movie.
[09:39.22]W: Oh, that¡¯d be great, 
[09:40.57]but our video machine is broken.
[09:43.08]M: Well, let¡¯s just play a game or something.
[09:46.77]W: Sounds good, but give me a call before you come. 
[09:50.48]My mom might try to 
[09:51.90]come up with something else for me to do.
[09:56.71]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation 
[10:00.79]you have just heard.
[10:03.42]12. What does Susan have to do on Saturday morning?
[10:22.48]13. What time will Susan meet Julie?
[10:41.91]14. How does Susan feel about her schedule on Saturday?
[11:01.71]15. Why can¡¯t they watch a video at Susan¡¯s house?
[11:22.36]Section B
[11:23.52]Directions: In this section, 
[11:25.81]you will hear 3 short passages. 
[11:28.61]At the end of each passage, 
[11:30.78]you will hear some questions. 
[11:32.91]Both the passage and the questions 
[11:35.53]will be spoken only once. 
[11:38.21]After you hear a question, 
[11:40.21]you must choose the best answer 
[11:42.60]from the four choices 
[11:44.09]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[11:47.14]Then mark the corresponding letter
[11:49.88]on Answer Sheet 1 
[11:51.70]with a single line through the centre.
[11:56.07]Passage One
[11:57.39]Charlie Parker is one of America¡¯s greatest jazz musicians. 
[12:02.37]He influenced the direction of jazz music 
[12:05.56]during his short lifetime. 
[12:07.45]He developed a new style of jazz called bebop. 
[12:11.76]Performers of bebop left the traditional musical melody 
[12:15.67]and played a song freely, 
[12:17.96]with the music and rhythm being felt at the same time. 
[12:22.26]So, the same song could be played 
[12:25.47]in a different way 
[12:26.49]each time it was performed. 
[12:28.58]Charlie Parker was born in 1920 
[12:32.11]and had his first saxophone in 1933. 
[12:36.19]Charlie developed as a musician 
[12:38.74]by playing with different groups 
[12:40.69]in public eating and drinking places called nightclubs. 
[12:45.18]Meanwhile, Charlie developed serious problems 
[12:49.02]that were to affect the rest of his life. 
[12:51.70]He became dependent on alcohol 
[12:54.71]and the illegal drug, heroin. 
[12:57.06]In 1939, Charlie went to New York City, 
[13:01.10]where he began to develop his own style of jazz. 
[13:05.22]Charlie Parker¡¯s name first appeared in 
[13:07.99]the press reports about music in 1940. 
[13:11.55]During the next five years, 
[13:13.67]he joined different bands. 
[13:15.92]He apparently did not feel at ease 
[13:18.94]playing with a bit of bands, 
[13:20.93]so he returned to New York City in 1947. 
[13:26.05]The following four years are considered 
[13:28.84]his most successful years. 
[13:31.36]He formed his own small bands 
[13:34.11]and played with other groups. 
[13:36.23]He visited Europe three times, 
[13:38.96]where he recorded about half of the albums 
[13:41.74]he had ever made. 
[13:43.43]His last public appearance was 
[13:46.08]on March 5, 1955, at Birdland. 
[13:51.17]It was not a success. 
[13:53.22]He died seven days later of a heart attack.
[13:58.54]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage 
[14:02.63]you have just heard.
[14:06.41]16. What does the speaker mainly talk about?
[14:26.30]17. What can we learn about Charlie¡¯s music style?
[14:46.77]18. Where did Charlie record about half of his albums?
[15:07.72]Passage Two
[15:09.41]Crime is a serious problem in Britain. 
[15:13.03]One sort of crime which particularly worries people
[15:16.31]is juvenile delinquency¡ª
[15:18.80]that is, crimes committed by young people. 
[15:21.97]For some years, juvenile delinquency has been increasing. 
[15:26.52]There are two main sorts of juvenile crime: 
[15:30.17]stealing and violence. 
[15:31.98]Most people do not understand 
[15:34.46]why young people commit these crimes. 
[15:37.05]There are, I think, a large number of different reasons. 
[15:41.55]These crimes are not usually committed by people 
[15:44.58]who are poor or in need. 
[15:46.92]Young people often dislike and resent the adult world. 
[15:51.10]They will do things to show that they are rebels. 
[15:54.55]Also in Britain today, 
[15:56.61]it is easier for young people to commit crimes 
[16:00.19]because they have more freedom
[16:02.09]to go where they like 
[16:03.43]and more money to do what they like. 
[16:06.38]There are two other possible causes 
[16:08.98]which are worth mentioning. 
[16:10.83]More and more people in Britain 
[16:12.80]live in large towns. 
[16:14.96]In a large town, 
[16:16.33]no one knows who anyone else is 
[16:19.23]or where he lives. 
[16:20.88]But in the village I come from 
[16:23.18]crimes are rare 
[16:24.98]because everybody knows each other.
[16:27.32]Although it is difficult to explain, 
[16:29.99]I think the last cause is very important. 
[16:33.46]Perhaps there is something wrong with our society
[16:36.88] which encourages violence and crime. 
[16:40.03]It is a fact that all the time 
[16:42.00]children are exposed to films and reports 
[16:44.96]about crime and violence. 
[16:46.83]Many people do not agree
[16:48.84]that this influences young people, 
[16:51.64]but I think that young people are very much influenced 
[16:55.31]by the society they grow up in. 
[16:57.83]I feel that the fault may be as much with our whole society 
[17:02.39]as with these young people.
[17:05.90]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage 
[17:10.38]you have just heard.
[17:13.08]19. What is ¡°juvenile delinquency¡±?
[17:32.42]20. Which are considered to be 
[17:35.12]the causes of juvenile delinquency?
[17:52.47]21. Who are to blame for juvenile delinquency 
[17:57.28]according to the speaker?
[18:13.58]Passage Three
[18:15.54]Many animals recognize their food 
[18:18.29]because they see it. 
[18:19.62]So do humans. 
[18:21.10]When you see an apple or a piece of chocolate, 
[18:24.14]you know that these are things 
[18:26.32]you can eat. 
[18:27.42]You can also use other senses 
[18:29.61]when you choose your food. 
[18:31.22]You may dislike some types of food 
[18:33.99]because they do not look, smell 
[18:36.40]or taste very nice. 
[18:38.27]Different animals use different senses 
[18:41.17]to find and choose their food. 
[18:43.48]A few animals depend on 
[18:45.20]only one of their senses, 
[18:47.55]while most animals use more than one sense. 
[18:51.28]Although there are many different types of food, 
[18:54.71]some animals spend their lives eating only one type. 
[18:59.12]The panda eats only one particular type of bamboo. 
[19:03.71]Other animals eat only one type of food 
[19:07.15]even when given the choice. 
[19:09.62]A kind of white butterfly will stay on the leaves of a cabbage, 
[19:14.16]even though there are plenty of other vegetables in the garden.
[19:18.47]However, most animals have a more varied diet. 
[19:23.05]The bear eats fruits, honey and fish.
[19:26.24]The fox eats small animals, birds and fruits. 
[19:30.48]The diet of these animals will be different 
[19:33.30]depending on the season. 
[19:35.24]Humans have a very varied diet. 
[19:38.27]We often eat food because we like it 
[19:41.48]and not because it is good for us. 
[19:44.01]In countries such as France and Britain, 
[19:46.80]people eat foods with too much sugar. 
[19:50.08]This makes them overweight, 
[19:52.05]which is bad for their health. 
[19:54.24]Eating too much red meat and animal products, 
[19:57.69]such as butter, can also be bad for the health. 
[20:01.48]Choosing the right food, therefore, 
[20:03.97]has become an area of study in modern life.
[20:08.84]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the conversation 
[20:14.35]you have just heard.
[20:17.59]22. How do most animals choose food? 
[20:37.21]23. Which of the following animals eats only one type of food?
[20:59.58]24. When do some certain animals change their choice of food?
[21:20.69]25. What can we know about people in France and Britain?
[21:41.51]Section C
[21:42.81]Directions: In this section, 
[21:45.54]you will hear a passage three times. 
[21:48.67]When the passage is read for the first time, 
[21:51.56]you should listen carefully for its general idea. 
[21:55.35]When the passage is read for the second time, 
[21:58.59]you are required to fill in the blanks 
[22:01.52]with the exact words you have just heard. 
[22:04.60]Finally, when the passage is read 
[22:07.10]for the third time, 
[22:08.77]you should check what you have written. 
[22:11.09]Now listen to the passage.
[25:20.42][23:46.62][22:14.28]Tourism really is a big business these days. 
[25:23.98][23:49.89][22:17.96]It¡¯s amazing. 
[25:25.33][23:51.17][22:19.20]It involves issues such as hotels, transportation, 
[25:29.38][23:55.18][22:23.26]restaurants, shops, and thousands of people. 
[25:33.07][23:58.83][22:27.06]The tour companies keep telling us 
[25:35.40][24:01.17][22:29.37]what a good thing it is 
[25:37.17][24:02.73][22:31.04]and how much we can learn about people and customs, 
[25:40.97][24:06.32][22:34.85]but sometimes I wonder if this is really true. 
[25:44.46][24:10.21][22:38.38]A couple that I know went abroad last summer. 
[25:48.24][24:13.72][22:42.08]They travelled with a tour group. 
[25:50.40][24:15.86][22:44.39]It¡¯s interesting to compare their experiences 
[25:53.50][24:19.02][22:47.30]with some of the experiences of other people 
[25:56.90][24:22.66][22:50.83]in the same tour group. 
[25:58.57][24:24.49][22:52.64]My friends, fortunately, had some acquaintances, or friends, 
[26:03.20][24:28.93][22:57.10]actually in some of the cities 
[26:05.45][24:30.93][22:59.26]they were going to. 
[26:06.83][24:32.34][23:00.68]Along the routes of their tour, 
[26:09.15][24:34.44][23:03.06]they could go out with some of the local people 
[26:11.75][24:37.28][23:05.75]and they could eat some of the local food 
[26:14.29][24:40.05][23:08.14]and may see some of the local sights. 
[26:17.33][24:43.12][23:11.45]Other members of the tour group, however, 
[26:20.34][24:45.87][23:14.24]never got away from the group at all. 
[26:23.05][24:49.00][23:16.97]They never went out and did a thing on their own. 
[26:26.68][24:52.53][23:20.62]Of course the tour company leaves it pretty much 
[26:29.73][24:55.31][23:23.63]up to the people to do whatever they want.
[26:32.29][24:58.50][23:26.41] I understand that people wouldn¡¯t go out on their own 
[26:36.07][25:02.33][23:29.96]because of language problems 
[26:38.17][25:04.36][23:31.93]and being a little bit afraid. 
[26:40.24][25:06.53][23:34.14]But it seems to me that 
[26:42.27][25:08.09][23:36.20]the more tourists can mix with local people, 
[26:44.74][25:11.38][23:38.91]the better off everyone is.
[23:42.71]Now the passage will be read again.
[25:16.33]Now the passage will be read for the third time.
[26:48.75]This is the end of listening comprehension.
