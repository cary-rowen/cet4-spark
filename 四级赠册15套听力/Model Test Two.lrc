[00:16.43]Model Test Two
[00:19.16]Section A
[00:20.59]Directions: In this section, 
[00:22.82]you will hear 8 short conversations 
[00:25.52]and 2 long conversations. 
[00:28.32]At the end of each conversation, 
[00:31.01]one or more questions will be asked 
[00:33.67]about what was said. 
[00:35.39]Both the conversation and the questions 
[00:38.77]will be spoken only once. 
[00:41.40]After each question there will be a pause. 
[00:44.82]During the pause, 
[00:46.41]you must read the four choices 
[00:48.78]marked A), B), C) and D), 
[00:52.03]and decide which is the best answer. 
[00:55.32]Then mark the corresponding letter 
[00:58.19]on Answer Sheet 1 
[00:59.90]with a single line through the centre. 
[01:02.88]Now let¡¯s begin with the eight short conversations.
[01:08.12]1. W: I¡¯m tired of Bill¡¯s remarks. 
[01:11.53]I don¡¯t know why he always overstates 
[01:14.52]what he experienced.
[01:16.21]M: Why don¡¯t you do 
[01:17.72]what I do? 
[01:18.76]Just take his comments 
[01:20.08]with a grain of salt.
[01:21.84]Q: What does the man suggest the woman do?
[01:39.96]2. M: I don¡¯t think John stands a chance 
[01:43.57]of winning a gold medal in this match.
[01:46.16]W: Maybe you are right, 
[01:47.33]but he¡¯s doing his best.
[01:49.70]Q: What does the man say about John?
[02:07.08]3. W: So you mean you need someone 
[02:10.14]to watch your cat while you are away?
[02:12.81]M: Yeah, and I think no one is more suitable 
[02:16.38]than you to do that. 
[02:18.17]Will that be a problem for you?
[02:20.80]Q: What does the man mean?
[02:37.47]4. M: If we hurry, 
[02:40.26]we can take the express train 
[02:42.38]instead of the local 
[02:44.11]and save an hour, can¡¯t we?
[02:46.59]W: Yes, the express train takes only three hours 
[02:49.93]to get to New York.
[02:51.71]Q: How long does it take 
[02:53.06]to get to New York by the local train?
[03:10.22]5. W: This doesn¡¯t look familiar at all. 
[03:14.77]We must be lost. 
[03:16.56]We¡¯d better get some directions.
[03:18.84]M: There is a policeman over there. 
[03:21.61]Let¡¯s pull in right here 
[03:23.66]and ask him for help.
[03:25.67]Q: Where are the two speakers?
[03:42.60]6. M: Prof. Jackson¡¯s lectures are tremendous. 
[03:47.04]Hardly anyone skips class.
[03:49.57]W: Yeah, you can even hear 
[03:51.32]a pin drop in the class.
[03:53.68]Q: What can we learn about Prof. Jackson?
[04:10.96]7. W: West London Air Terminal, please. 
[04:15.33]I have to be there by 11:10.
[04:18.06]M: I can¡¯t promise, Miss, 
[04:19.76]but I¡¯ll do my best.
[04:21.61]Q: Who is the woman most probably talking to?
[04:40.08]8. M:  It¡¯s going to be fine tomorrow.
[04:43.33]W: Anyway, I¡¯ll bring a raincoat. 
[04:45.54]I don¡¯t want to get wet like this again.
[04:48.78]Q: What is the weather like today?
[05:05.98]Now you¡¯ll hear the two long conversations.
[05:09.63]Conversation One
[05:11.87]M: Hi, Mary. Do you want to 
[05:13.73]start writing a lab report 
[05:15.54]after we finish this experiment?
[05:17.53]W: I can¡¯t. In fact, I need to finish early 
[05:20.64]because I¡¯m going to the psychology department 
[05:23.67]to talk to Prof. Smith about a job opening.
[05:27.54]M: You mean a job on campus?
[05:29.56]W: Yeah. And it sounds pretty interesting. 
[05:32.38]It involves helping with her study on learning styles.
[05:36.33]M: Yeah. I know that¡¯s her area of expertise.
[05:40.21]W: Right. Anyway, she¡¯s taking some high school students 
[05:43.84]who aren¡¯t doing very well in their classes 
[05:46.21]and testing them to find out 
[05:48.47]what their learning styles are. 
[05:50.57]Then tutors, people like me, 
[05:52.98]will work with her, 
[05:54.32]presenting material to the students 
[05:56.50]according to their particular learning styles.
[05:59.85]M: Are you getting paid for this?
[06:02.04]W: I¡¯m sure we¡¯ll get something, 
[06:04.06]though probably not much. 
[06:06.14]Anyway, it doesn¡¯t matter to me, 
[06:08.38]I just want to get some hands-on experience.
[06:11.69]M: Yeah. And it¡¯ll be nice 
[06:14.17]to help those high school students too.
[06:17.15]W: That¡¯s what I thought when I saw the ad. 
[06:19.49]You could do it too.
[06:21.18]M: Really? Do you have any idea 
[06:23.74]about what the schedule is like?
[06:26.03]W: Late afternoon until evening for tutoring, I think. 
[06:29.75]After all, the kids are in regular classes until 3:30.
[06:34.28]M: Actually, that¡¯s perfect for me.
[06:36.81]W: Then come along. 
[06:38.06]We will save the lab report for later. 
[06:40.70]But we¡¯d better make sure 
[06:42.25]we do a good job on our experiment first.
[06:45.54]M: Yeah. First things first.
[06:49.26]Questions 9 to 11 are based on the conversation 
[06:53.62]you have just heard.
[06:57.01]9. What will the tutors do 
[07:00.51]for the high school students?
[07:17.69]10. Why does the woman want to take the job?
[07:37.26]11. What will the speakers probably do next?
[07:56.56]Conversation Two
[07:59.15]W: Dr. White, we recently learned 
[08:01.31]that a large piece of the Larsen Ice Shelf 
[08:04.24]in Western Antarctica 
[08:05.94]melted in early January. 
[08:08.43]Could you please tell us exactly what happened?
[08:11.68]M: I¡¯d be happy to. 
[08:13.48]The piece that melted was 
[08:15.46]over 1 000 square miles in area. 
[08:18.66]More recently and quite alarming to scientists is 
[08:22.95]that a 40-mile crack, some 30 feet wide in places 
[08:27.57]has torn through the ice shelf.
[08:29.98]W: I understand that 
[08:31.50]the scientific community is quite concerned. 
[08:34.60]What is the significance of these events?
[08:37.50]M: Well, some scientists believe that 
[08:40.46]this is a clear sign of global warming. 
[08:43.48]Back in 1978, some American researchers predicted 
[08:48.68]that Antarctica would show early signs of global warming 
[08:53.10]due to the green house effect.
[08:55.64]W: But couldn¡¯t crumbling ice shelves also be a result 
[08:58.85]of the unusual weather 
[09:00.50]Antarctica itself has experienced lately?
[09:03.95]M: That¡¯s certainly possible, 
[09:05.78]but you¡¯ll have to remember 
[09:07.76]that over the past thousands of years, 
[09:10.22]ice shelves have been through a lot of weather changes 
[09:13.83]without breaking up.
[09:15.31]W: I think most people know 
[09:16.78]that if the ice cap over Antarctica melts, 
[09:19.88]the level of the oceans will rise. 
[09:22.61]What sort of impact will this have?
[09:25.14]M: Well, the ice shelves currently 
[09:27.55]insulate the Antarctic continent from wind, 
[09:30.88]which slows down the melting. 
[09:32.78]If the winds cause 
[09:34.52]even a tenth of the continent¡¯s ice to melt, 
[09:37.23]the world¡¯s oceans could rise as much as 30 feet.
[09:41.95]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation 
[09:47.13]you have just heard.
[09:50.29]12. What are the speakers mainly discussing?
[10:10.49]13. Why are the melting events of the ice important?
[10:30.61]14. Why doesn¡¯t the man believe 
[10:34.17]weather changes result in ice melting?
[10:52.01]15. What would be the likely result 
[10:55.43]of the melting of the ice cap?
[11:12.42]Section B
[11:13.84]Directions: In this section, 
[11:16.14]you will hear 3 short passages. 
[11:19.00]At the end of each passage, 
[11:21.12]you will hear some questions. 
[11:23.27]Both the passage and the questions 
[11:25.84]will be spoken only once. 
[11:28.40]After you hear a question, 
[11:30.47]you must choose the best answer 
[11:32.85]from the four choices 
[11:34.43]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[11:37.46]Then mark the corresponding letter 
[11:40.13]on Answer Sheet 1 
[11:41.99]with a single line through the centre.
[11:45.62]Passage One
[11:47.02]It is a great honor for me 
[11:48.54]to introduce today¡¯s guest¡ªlecturer Henry Taylor. 
[11:53.57]Dr. Taylor received his B.A. degree in Urban History 
[11:57.94]at Yale University in 1955. 
[12:01.96]Five years later, 
[12:03.47]he was awarded a master¡¯s degree in Architectures 
[12:06.98]and a Ph.D. in Urban Design from Cornell University. 
[12:12.00]Upon graduating, he accepted a teaching position 
[12:15.63]in the Department of Architecture and Fine Arts 
[12:18.93]at Illinois University 
[12:21.03]where he was promoted to chairman of the department in 1969. 
[12:26.57]Last year, Dr. Taylor resigned from the university 
[12:30.84]in order to accept a research position with 
[12:34.36]the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington 
[12:38.63]as director of planning. 
[12:40.70]In addition to teaching and research, 
[12:43.08]Dr. Taylor has devoted much time 
[12:45.76]to designing, writing, and lecturing. 
[12:48.89]Some of his most famous buildings 
[12:51.27]are right here in the Chicago area, 
[12:53.82]including the Twin Towers office building 
[12:56.81]and the Saint Lawrence Seaway Recreation Center. 
[13:00.58]His many articles on functional architecture and urban planning 
[13:05.18]have appeared in scores of journals 
[13:07.67]over the past 20 years, 
[13:09.56]and half a dozen textbooks are to his credit, 
[13:13.47]including one of the books 
[13:15.24]that we use for this seminar¡ª
[13:17.28]Trends in Urban Design. 
[13:19.37]Today, Dr. Taylor will speak to us 
[13:22.91]about federal regulations for urban development, 
[13:26.44]and frankly, I know of no one 
[13:29.06]more qualified to the address. 
[13:31.72]Now, let¡¯s welcome Henry Taylor.
[13:36.29]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage 
[13:41.50]you have just heard.
[13:44.01]16. What subject did Dr. Taylor study for his Ph.D.?
[14:05.55]17. Where did Dr. Taylor resign from 
[14:10.24]in order to accept a research position?
[14:28.36]18. What is today¡¯s topic of Dr. Taylor¡¯s lecture?
[14:49.16]Passage Two
[14:50.58]When cars first started appearing on the street of the world, 
[14:54.72]there were only few people who took them seriously, 
[14:58.53]because they thought they were toys¡ª
[15:00.87]play things for grown men 
[15:02.82]who didn¡¯t have much time to play. 
[15:05.64]No one thought that
[15:07.12]the automobile would ever become 
[15:09.57]the world¡¯s most popular form of transportation 
[15:12.92]after many years. 
[15:14.75]When Henry Ford started selling his Model T in 1908, 
[15:20.18]he changed the situation. 
[15:22.45]Ford believed that a car should be the low-cost transportation 
[15:26.64]that everyone could afford, 
[15:28.96]so he decided to make such a car. 
[15:31.85]First he wanted a dependable automobile 
[15:35.64]that wouldn¡¯t be broken down easily. 
[15:38.74]Then he wanted a simple engine 
[15:41.21]that almost anyone could repair. 
[15:44.16]Ford wanted to sell the car at a low price 
[15:47.57]so that many people who were not very rich 
[15:50.90]could afford one. 
[15:52.10]And because of this, 
[15:53.73]he had to make it at a very low cost. 
[15:57.24]Finally, he made only one model 
[16:00.13]in only one color¡ªblack. 
[16:03.16]In 1932, the Duesenberg brothers produced a car 
[16:07.38]that many people thought 
[16:09.23]as the brightest automobile ever made. 
[16:12.73]The very car called Duesenberg was custom-made, 
[16:16.79]so each one was different. 
[16:18.95]But it usually weighed about 7 000 pounds 
[16:23.05]and had a very wide wheelbase 
[16:25.67]which was 150 inches. 
[16:28.14]It also had an enormous 400 horsepower engine 
[16:32.61]that could move the car 
[16:34.00]from 0 to 100 miles per hour in 17 seconds.
[16:40.75]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage 
[16:44.87]you have just heard.
[16:47.48]19. How did people think of cars 
[16:50.89]when they first started appearing on the street?
[17:08.50]20. Why did Henry Ford make only one model 
[17:13.17]in only one color? 
[17:29.83]21. What does the passage mainly talk about?
[17:48.98]Passage Three
[17:50.70]Many of us often complain 
[17:52.38]that we cannot remember things 
[17:54.84]or easily forget things. 
[17:57.06]However, memory, they say, 
[17:59.54]is a matter of practice and exercise. 
[18:02.46]If you have the wish and really make a conscious effort 
[18:06.44]to remember things, 
[18:07.62]then you can quite easily improve your ability 
[18:10.85]to remember them. 
[18:12.26]But even if you are successful, 
[18:14.70]there are times when your memory seems to 
[18:17.24]play tricks on you. 
[18:18.80]It often happens 
[18:20.12]that we remember things 
[18:21.72]that did not really happen. 
[18:24.14]One morning last week, for example, 
[18:26.87]I got up and found 
[18:28.38]that I had left the front door 
[18:30.14]unlocked all night, 
[18:31.77]yet I clearly remembered locking it carefully 
[18:35.05]the night before.  
[18:36.41]What¡¯s more, memory ¡°tricks¡± work the other way as well. 
[18:41.18]Once in a while, 
[18:42.29]we remember not doing something 
[18:44.59]and then find out that we did it. 
[18:47.31]One day last month, for example, 
[18:49.71]I was sitting in a barber shop 
[18:51.74]waiting for my turn to get a haircut, 
[18:54.33]and suddenly I realized 
[18:55.90]that I got a haircut two days ago 
[18:58.48]at the barber shop across the street 
[19:01.02]from my office. 
[19:02.37]Frequently, we seem to 
[19:03.81]find something funny and amusing 
[19:05.95]in incidents caused by 
[19:07.85]people¡¯s forgetfulness or absent-mindedness. 
[19:11.30]Stories about absent-mindedness 
[19:14.04]have been told for years, 
[19:15.95]and we never get tired of hearing new ones. 
[19:18.88]Unfortunately, however, absent-mindedness is not always funny.
[19:24.23] There are times when ¡°tricks¡± of our memory 
[19:27.31]can cause us great trouble.
[19:31.15]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage 
[19:35.87]you have just heard.
[19:39.26]22. What should we do 
[19:42.56]if we want to have a good memory?
[20:00.25]23. What can we learn about the speaker?
[20:21.09]24. What can we infer about absent-mindedness 
[20:26.48]from this passage?
[20:43.00]25. What will absent-mindedness cause us sometimes 
[20:48.77]according to the passage?
[21:05.63]Section C
[21:07.23]Directions: In this section, 
[21:09.63]you will hear a passage three times. 
[21:12.83]When the passage is read for the first time, 
[21:15.72]you should listen carefully for its general idea. 
[21:19.45]When the passage is read for the second time, 
[21:22.76]you are required to fill in the blanks 
[21:25.61]with the exact words 
[21:27.11]you have just heard.
[21:28.70]Finally, when the passage is read 
[21:31.18]for the third time, 
[21:32.86]you should check what you have written. 
[21:35.26]Now listen to the passage.
[25:50.05][23:44.73][21:38.53]As we all know, 
[25:51.50][23:46.77][21:39.67]drinking and smoking affect people¡¯s health. 
[25:55.04][23:50.17][21:43.38]A recent study of 17 000 Canadians 
[25:58.52][23:53.78][21:46.87]shows that people who drink beer with limits 
[26:02.14][23:57.13][21:50.45]are healthier than people 
[26:03.70][23:58.75][21:52.09]who drink other alcoholic beverages, 
[26:06.85][24:01.37][21:55.23]such as wine or liquor. 
[26:09.00][24:03.65][21:57.36]Researchers say they don¡¯t yet know exactly why this is so. 
[26:14.16][24:08.53][22:02.50]They find, however, 
[26:15.89][24:10.34][22:04.20]that moderate beer-drinkers are reported less illness 
[26:20.02][24:14.57][22:08.36]and appear to have a lower risk of death from heart disease. 
[26:25.20][24:18.66][22:13.78]Health condition seems to be connected to 
[26:28.23][24:22.01][22:16.52]the amount of beer consumed 
[26:30.46][24:24.23][22:18.87]and the regularity of drinking. 
[26:32.81][24:26.73][22:21.22]People who drink beer one or more times a day 
[26:36.34][24:29.90][22:24.75]are reported to get the least chance of illness.
[26:40.01][24:33.46][22:28.54]Heavy drinkers, however, people who drink 35 or more pints of beer a week 
[26:46.18][24:39.37][22:34.45]reported more illness. 
[26:48.38][24:41.58][22:36.75]For the sake of their health, 
[26:50.36][24:43.47][22:38.77]many people oppose heavy drinking of beer 
[26:53.56][24:46.53][22:41.94]just as they do with smoking. 
[26:56.00][24:48.97][22:44.34]The war against cigarette smoking is heating up again. 
[26:59.92][24:53.16][22:48.31]Legislation was introduced today that would make it illegal 
[27:04.12][24:57.30][22:52.47]to advertise cigarettes, cigars, or any other tobacco products 
[27:09.63][25:02.38][22:57.91]in any form of media. 
[27:11.37][25:04.38][22:59.94]That means ads would be banned from 
[27:13.86][25:06.60][23:02.18]newspapers, magazines, television, radio, and billboards. 
[27:18.84][25:11.67][23:07.30]The legislation would also prevent tobacco manufacturers 
[27:22.81][25:15.79][23:11.16]from sponsoring sporting events 
[27:25.36][25:18.12][23:13.65]and from giving away free samples. 
[27:28.16][25:21.06][23:16.63]This is the strongest anti-smoking legislation
[27:31.84][25:24.77][23:20.22] that has been introduced to date. 
[27:34.27][25:27.43][23:22.68]Cigarette manufacturers insisit that 
[27:37.31][25:30.51][23:25.69]the legislation would be useless. 
[27:39.72][25:33.10][23:28.03]In fact, they claim that
