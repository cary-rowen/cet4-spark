[00:20.54]Part ¢ò Listening Comprehension
[00:23.70]Section A
[00:25.52]Directions: In this section,
[00:28.13]you will hear 8 short conversations and 2 long conversations.
[00:33.26]At the end of each conversation,
[00:35.36]one or more questions will be asked about what was said.
[00:39.30]Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once.
[00:44.23]After each question there will be a pause.
[00:47.23]During the pause,
[00:48.66]you must read the four choices marked A), B), C) and D),
[00:53.66]and decide which is the best answer.
[00:56.54]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[01:00.48]with a single line through the centre.
[01:03.35]Now let¡¯s begin with the eight short conversations.
[01:08.38]1. M: Sally, how are you getting along with the translation work?
[01:13.98]W: I have written and rewritten so much that I don¡¯t know
[01:17.54]if I¡¯ll ever get it finished.
[01:19.87]Q: How does Sally feel?
[01:36.62]2. W: Bob, have you saved enough money to buy your dream camera?
[01:42.60]M: I count my money every evening and I am saving every cent.
[01:47.89]Q: What does the man mean?
[02:04.62]3. M: I¡¯m sorry to hear that you lost your wallet
[02:09.39]on your trip to the National Park.
[02:11.58]W: Well, luckily, my husband keeps all the passports and cash.
[02:16.01]But reporting the loss of all my credit cards
[02:18.65]to the banks is really annoying.
[02:21.97]Q: What bothers the woman?
[02:38.36]4. W: I¡¯m a little worried about Jill.
[02:41.99]She has got a bad cold,
[02:44.05]yet she insists on practicing every day.
[02:47.27]M: She should take it easy until she is over it.
[02:51.40]Q: What does the man mean?
[03:08.16]5. M: Look at that dog: its eyes,
[03:12.45]its nose and its ears.
[03:14.41]Don¡¯t you think it¡¯s so cute?
[03:16.68]W: Dear, don¡¯t you forget we have already got two dogs and a cat?
[03:21.31]Don¡¯t tell me you want to take it home with us.
[03:25.36]Q: What does the woman mean?
[03:42.38]6. W: How time flies! Final exams will start next Monday
[03:48.45]but I haven¡¯t finished reading all the assignment yet.
[03:51.83]M: Time flies?
[03:53.18]I¡¯m looking forward to the winter vacation since Thanksgiving.
[03:57.56]Q: What can we learn from the conversation?
[04:15.07]7. M: Excuse me.
[04:17.73]I¡¯m looking for a handbag that can match my clothes.
[04:21.19]Where can I get one?
[04:23.62]W: Go to the ground floor.
[04:25.18]The handbag shelves are right between the watches and the shoes.
[04:29.45]Q: What is the man looking for?
[04:46.43]8. W: Can you cook at your apartment?
[04:50.11]M: Yes, I can.
[04:51.36]But my schedule is too busy and the school canteen is nice and cheap.
[04:56.79]Q: What can we learn about the man?
[05:13.71]Now you will hear the two long conversations.

[05:18.88]Conversation One
[05:21.44]W: Do you think families have changed much in the last 50 years?
[05:25.68]M: I think families everywhere have changed a lot in the last five decades.
[05:31.03]W: What do you think is the biggest change?
[05:33.99]M: Well, in the past,
[05:35.64]three or four generations would live together under the same roof.
[05:39.92]Nowadays, relatives living in the same city have become rare.
[05:44.57]W: That¡¯s true.
[05:45.57]You know, some husbands and wives
[05:47.72]don¡¯t even live in the same city any more.
[05:50.99]M: Would you ever consider having your parents
[05:53.53]live with you when they get older?
[05:55.79]W: I guess I¡¯m a bit old-fashioned.
[05:57.95]I¡¯d rather have my parents live with me than live in a retirement home.
[06:02.51]M: That¡¯s very respectable,
[06:04.15]but I could never live with my parents.
[06:06.70]I usually only see them at our Christmas celebration and that¡¯s enough!
[06:12.34]W: How about your other siblings?
[06:14.83]Do they spend a lot of time with your parents?
[06:17.45]M: Two of my sisters still live at home,
[06:19.57]even thought they have already graduated from university and had jobs.
[06:24.36]They enjoy spending their free time with my parents.
[06:27.72]I guess in that respect,
[06:29.44]I¡¯m the black sheep of the family.
[06:31.99]W: I see.
[06:33.41]Do your parents ever ask you to come home to visit them more often?
[06:37.77]M: They¡¯re always asking me to come home,
[06:40.44]but I think our relationship is better 
[06:43.29]if we keep a distance from each other.
[06:45.04]Whenever we see each other,
[06:46.56]all we do is fight.
[06:49.05]W: Well, you know what they say,
[06:50.97]¡°you can choose your friends,
[06:52.56]but not your family.¡±
[06:55.87]Questions 9 to 12 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[07:02.31]9. What does the man think is the biggest change in family?
[07:22.59]10. What does the woman wish when her parents get older?
[07:42.51]11. Why does the man say he is the black sheep of the family?
[08:02.61]12. Why is the man unwilling to live with his parents?
[08:22.58]Conversation Two
[08:24.99]W: How is your house hunting going?
[08:27.12]M: Not very well.
[08:28.28]I haven¡¯t found anything within my price range yet.
[08:32.19]W: How much do you want to spend?
[08:34.38]M: I can only afford about ¡ê300 a month.
[08:38.40]W: Looks like you¡¯re not going to get more than a bedroom
[08:40.96]in a shared flat with that.
[08:43.03]M: Really? That¡¯s a lot of money to pay for one room.
[08:47.00]Do you know of anyone who needs a roommate?
[08:49.78]W: Well, if you want to live in London,
[08:51.81]you have to pay the price! I can ask around at work.
[08:55.88]Do you have a preference for smokers or non-smokers?
[08:59.42]M: I¡¯d prefer non-smoking roommates,
[09:01.82]but I guess I¡¯ll have to take what I can get!
[09:05.29]W: How long do you want to sign a contract for?
[09:08.13]M: I can sign a contract up to a year.
[09:10.67]I don¡¯t know where I¡¯ll be after that.
[09:13.52]W: Do you need a furnished or unfurnished apartment?
[09:17.00]M: I don¡¯t have any furniture,
[09:18.99]so it would be great if it were furnished.
[09:20.96]W: You know that you¡¯ll have to pay utilities on top of the rent,right?
[09:24.93]M: No, I thought that would be included in the rent.
[09:28.54]W: It¡¯s not usually included,
[09:30.37]so you¡¯ll have to factor in about ¡ê100 more each month for utilities.
[09:35.38]M: I don¡¯t think I can afford that.
[09:37.80]W: Don¡¯t worry. Sometimes people will give you a discount
[09:40.88]if you promise to do the cleaning or take care of the lawn.
[09:44.51]M: That¡¯s a good idea.
[09:46.07]I¡¯ll look into finding something like that.
[09:50.53]Questions 13 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[09:57.66]13. What has the man been doing recently?
[10:17.10]14. What kind of roommates will the man prefer?
[10:36.71]15. What should the man do if he wants to get a discount?
[10:56.31]Section B
[10:58.02]Directions: In this section,
[11:00.72]you will hear 3 short passages.
[11:03.94]At the end of each passage,
[11:06.08]you will hear some questions.
[11:08.38]Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once.
[11:13.97]After you hear a question,
[11:16.19]you must choose the best answer from the four choices 
[11:21.16]marked A), B), C) and D).
[11:25.15]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[11:29.40]with a single line through the centre.
[11:32.85]Passage One
[11:34.55]Passion fruit is the edible fruit of the passion flower.
[11:38.84]Spanish explorers coined the name passion fruit 
[11:43.03]in honor of the passion of Christ.
[11:44.90]For them, the appearance of the passion flower 
[11:48.33]symbolized many Christian beliefs.
[11:50.65]It¡¯s also called parcha, markisa and konyal.
[11:55.62]Passion fruit grows on a vine in its native tropical 
[11:59.47]and subtropical regions.
[12:00.81]Commercially, it¡¯s grown in Brazil,
[12:03.81]the Caribbean, Australia, Africa
[12:05.88]and some areas of the southern United States.
[12:09.52]Because of its beautiful flower and the high demand for the fruit,
[12:13.45]passion fruit is successfully cultivated 
[12:16.77]in native as well as non-native areas.
[12:19.86]There are two types of passion fruit:
[12:22.59]purple passion fruit and yellow passion fruit.
[12:26.10]They are different in appearance but taste the same.
[12:29.49]The former one is about the size of a large egg,
[12:32.77]oval shaped with a purple-brown skin.
[12:35.90]The latter one is a bit larger,
[12:38.32]round and about the size of an orange.
[12:41.21]This type is bright yellow on the outside.
[12:44.59]Both contain a jelly-like pulp inside 
[12:48.11]with hundreds of small black seeds.
[12:50.63]Passion fruit is popular in gourmet cooking.
[12:53.90]It is used in many desserts,
[12:56.04]such as passion fruit mango mousse and passion fruit brulee.
[13:01.07]Some jams are made of passion fruit.
[13:03.86]Passion fruit is also used in main dishes,
[13:06.93]such as lobster with passion fruit butter sauce.
[13:11.11]Juice, punch, liqueurs and cocktails 
[13:14.73]have a tropical flair when made with it.
[13:18.69]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[13:24.10]16.Why do Spanish people call the fruit passion fruit?
[13:44.60]17.Which of the following is the growth place of passion fruit?
[14:05.46]18.What do we know about the yellow passion fruit£¿
[14:25.16]Passage Two
[14:26.71]I had spent my last day in London visiting friends,
[14:30.02]taking pictures,
[14:31.06]and doing some shopping.
[14:33.28]I had bought some presents: a shirt for my brother,
[14:37.92]a book for my sister,
[14:38.06]and a clock for my father.
[14:40.23]After travelling in a crowded bus and waiting 
[14:43.95]in the noisy airport building,
[14:45.20]I was glad to be sitting in the plane at last.
[14:48.93]In a few minutes,
[14:50.24]we would be asked to fasten our seat belts and to stop smoking,
[14:53.87]and then we would soon be up in the sky on our flight to Berlin.
[14:58.88]But I had been mistaken.
[15:00.72]Ten minutes later,
[15:01.90]instead of enjoying the beauty of the evening sky 
[15:05.63]from high above the clouds,
[15:07.19]I was forced to sit in a smoke-filled room
[15:10.25]with an airline official and a police officer at my side.
[15:15.25]On the table in front of me was one of my suitcases.
[15:18.90]The officials were very polite.
[15:21.40]They asked me to show them my passport,
[15:24.47]my ticket,and my baggage check.
[15:26.40]Then I was requested to open the suitcase
[15:29.12]and to spread out its contents on the table.
[15:32.57]I did as I was told.
[15:34.38]The moment I placed the alarm clock on the table,
[15:36.86]the two officials looked at each other and smiled.
[15:40.25]Hearing the clock ticking away merrily,
[15:42.61]I suddenly understood.
[15:44.79]Someone must have heard the ticking noise coming from my suitcase
[15:48.75]and thought there was a time bomb hidden in it.
[15:53.46]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[15:58.68]19. What present did the speaker buy for her father?
[16:18.30]20. What was the speaker doing ten minutes later 
[16:22.68]after she got on the plane?
[16:39.31]21. Why did the speaker get off the plane?
[16:58.77]Passage Three
[17:00.81]Sports have unwritten rules,
[17:02.88]so does business¡ªand violators are often punished just as swiftly.
[17:09.23]Here are some of them.
[17:11.16]First of all,never dress above your position.
[17:14.48]Everybody knows that dressing for success is important in the job.
[17:19.20]It¡¯s also the surest way to draw the not-so-friendly fire of colleagues.
[17:24.55]Dress slightly ¡°better¡± if you want¡ªbut just slightly.
[17:29.00]Otherwise you¡¯ll be perceived as a shameless climber.
[17:32.50]The only time this doesn¡¯t apply is if you run your own business,
[17:36.55]but even then you should dress in a way that enhances your image
[17:40.96]while ensuring customers feel comfortable.
[17:44.05]Besides, never embarrass a peer in a meeting.
[17:47.39]A colleague proposes an idea.
[17:49.69]It stinks. Not your job to say so,though.
[17:53.51]If you¡¯re a supervisor and another supervisor 
[17:57.18]makes a terrible suggestion
[17:58.28]that doesn¡¯t affect your area or your employees,sit tight.
[18:03.12]Let someone else,preferably someone above you,shoot it down.
[18:07.72]Then jump in if you can to modify the idea so it is more workable,
[18:13.12]giving credit to the other supervisor 
[18:16.06]for raising an important issue,of course.
[18:18.73]Bad ideas come and go,but professional relationships should be forever.
[18:24.12]Furthermore, never ¡°borrow¡± someone¡¯s idea.
[18:27.68]Business owner, CEO, supervisor, entry-level employee...doesn¡¯t matter.
[18:33.45]Always give credit where credit is due.
[18:36.47]Steal an idea,and the victim never forgets.
[18:40.26]And don¡¯t fall back on the old,¡°Well, they work for me,
[18:44.55]and we¡¯re a team...so I was just raising the idea on behalf of the team.¡±
[18:49.67]No one goes for that excuse but you.
[18:53.89]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[18:59.12]22. According to the speaker,
[19:02.14]what is the similarity between sports and business?
[19:20.63]23. What will happen when someone dresses improperly in the company?
[19:41.50]24. What should we do if a colleague proposes a bad idea?
[20:01.72]25. What does the speaker say about ideas?
[20:20.99]Section C
[20:22.49]Directions: In this section,
[20:24.85]you will hear a passage three times.
[20:28.13]When the passage is read for the first time,
[20:31.25]you should listen carefully for its general idea.
[20:35.02]When the passage is read for the second time,
[20:38.41]you are required to fill in the blanks 
[20:41.99]with the exact words you have just heard.
[20:44.28]Finally, when the passage is read for the third time,
[20:48.76]you should check what you have written.
[20:51.63]Now listen to the passage.
[20:54.52]For the newcomer,America can be a lonely place at first.
[20:58.61]This is partly due to the career-driven 
[21:01.85]and transitory nature of our society.
[21:04.33]One¡¯s career may force one¡¯s family 
[21:07.61]to move many times to many different locales.
[21:10.12]Unlike more traditional cultures 
[21:12.80]with strong extended family and long-term relationships,
[21:16.13]friendships are made and lost readily here.
[21:19.54]Some might find Americans superficial and even selfish.
[21:24.05]However, it is possible to make close relationships
[21:28.35]¡ªit is just more difficult,
[21:29.78]depending on where you live.
[21:32.33]Social relationships in the US,by and large,
[21:35.28]revolve around one¡¯s career and hobbies,
[21:38.48]one¡¯s religion and one¡¯s cultural background.
[21:41.56]In the large cities and towns,
[21:43.40]there are many opportunities to get involved 
[21:46.48]in social and cultural activities,
[21:48.12]with a multitude of hobbyist clubs and associations catering
[21:52.72]to almost every interest: travelling,cooking, writing, dining out,
[21:57.82]sailing and water sports.
[22:00.16]If you love to read books or watch films,
[22:02.82]for example, there are a number of clubs 
[22:06.04]in large cities catering to these interests.
[22:08.72]If you like nature, you can join hiking clubs 
[22:12.63]or environmental organizations.
[22:14.71]Good ways to meet Americans include sports and athletic clubs,i.e.
[22:20.09]tennis clubs, children¡¯s sports like Little League,
[22:23.83]joining the PTA at your children¡¯s school
[22:26.73]or volunteering at your children¡¯s school or church.
[22:30.26]Learn the basic rules of these games.
[22:33.07]Learning a sport like golf,
[22:34.96]tennis or even basketball can be an excellent way to meet friends
[22:39.20]and strengthen relationships with business colleagues and clients.
[22:45.32]Now the passage will be read again.
[22:47.83]For the newcomer,America can be a lonely place at first.
