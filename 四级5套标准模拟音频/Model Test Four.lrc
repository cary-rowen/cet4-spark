[00:16.28]Model Test Four
[00:18.17]Part ¢ò Listening Comprehension
[00:21.15]Section A
[00:23.21]Directions:  In this section,
[00:26.04]you will hear 8 short conversations and 2 long conversations.
[00:30.96]At the end of each conversation,
[00:33.19]one or more questions will be asked about what was said.
[00:37.02]Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once.
[00:42.34]After each question there will be a pause.
[00:45.06]During the pause,
[00:46.32]you must read the four choices marked A),B), C) and D),
[00:51.52]and decide which is the best answer.
[00:54.26]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:58.40]with a single line through the centre.
[01:01.13]Now let¡¯s begin with the eight short conversations.
[01:05.89]1. M: What do you do in class when students do not speak English
[01:10.78]but speak their own languages instead?
[01:13.65]W: I don¡¯t know.
[01:14.89]I mean, I haven¡¯t had much success really,
[01:17.86]so I¡¯ve actually been pretty casual about it.
[01:21.20]Q: What are the two speakers talking about?
[01:38.83]2. M: Good afternoon, I want to borrow some books on psychology,
[01:44.44]for Prof. Li¡¯s class.
[01:47.41]W: Sorry, all the books have been checked out.
[01:50.10]Do you see the girl over there?
[01:51.87]She is waiting for the same books.
[01:54.38]Why don¡¯t you come and try tomorrow?
[01:56.83]Q: What does the woman suggest the man do?
[02:14.24]3. W: Can I take your order for an appetizer?
[02:18.33]M: I quite like the look of several of these.
[02:21.20]Now the melon.
[02:22.38]Does that come with anything else?
[02:25.20]Q: What¡¯s the probable relationship between the two speakers?
[02:43.95]4. M: So, Susan, can you talk about American high schools£¿
[02:49.57]What are American high schools like?
[02:52.59]W: In fact,I think that depends on the district,the state,
[02:56.35]and the area of the state in which you live.
[02:59.84]Q: What does the woman say about the high schools in America?
[03:18.39]5. M: How much of the English has changed
[03:22.35]since the original Shakespeare to the Shakespeare we have today,
[03:26.29]I mean the English we have today?
[03:29.22]W: Well, if Shakespeare suddenly appeared in the 21st century
[03:33.39]he would be almost illiterate.
[03:36.45]Q: What does the woman mean?
[03:53.38]6. W: OK, why did you choose to get an MBA?
[03:58.58]You don¡¯t seem like a guy of the business type.
[04:01.13]M: It is not really what I love to learn,
[04:03.41]but I think it will give me an edge to get a job.
[04:06.88]Q: Why is the man studying to get an MBA?
[04:25.63]7. W: Are you going to tell your roommate
[04:28.95]he has to move out since he¡¯s a bit sluggish?
[04:32.45]M: I would never ask him to move out,
[04:34.83]but I¡¯m just going to try to whip him into shape.
[04:38.80]Q: What does the man intend to do about his roommate?
[04:57.66]8. M: Sarah, let¡¯s talk about technology.
[05:01.85]These days we have all types of new technology.
[05:05.80]W: Can we just end this right now?
[05:08.33]I¡¯d rather talk about something else,
[05:10.39]like fashion,literature, or movies.
[05:13.89]Q: What can be inferred from the conversation?
[05:28.35]Now you will hear the two long conversations.
[05:34.96]Conversation One
[05:37.19]W: Hello! Can you introduce yourself please?
[05:40.21]M: Sure, my name is Steven Patterson
[05:43.15]and I¡¯m from a small town called Brentwood
[05:46.22]in Essex which is in England.
[05:48.93]W: OK, Essex.
[05:50.72]Which part of England is that?
[05:52.60]M: That¡¯s in the southeast.
[05:54.32]W: Southeast.
[05:55.44]M: Yeah, yeah. It¡¯s attached to London,just next to London.
[06:00.25]W: Oh, OK, but you said it¡¯s a small town.
[06:03.97]M: It¡¯s relatively small. The population is about 50 000.
[06:09.50]W: OK, well, what kind of place is your town where you grew up?
[06:13.83]M: It¡¯s actually a very nice and prosperous town.
[06:17.33]People often travel out from Brentwood into London
[06:20.38]and they work in the city,
[06:22.92]because it¡¯s a pleasant place to live in.
[06:26.27]W: Oh, it sounds nice.
[06:28.04]Well, now if you live in a little town near London,
[06:31.91]will it be really expensive?
[06:34.15]M: Yes, because it¡¯s a desirable place to live in Brentwood
[06:38.06]and the closeness to London also makes the housing quite expensive.
[06:43.77]W: Oh, really, when I think of a small British village,
[06:47.44]you know,I think of really old houses,and nothing¡¯s changed,
[06:52.05]so do you have modern stuff,like a health club,
[06:55.68]a movie theatre or things like that?
[06:58.32]M: The cinema in Brentwood actually closed down,
[07:01.49]but it does have a very nice health centre
[07:04.39]and as I said lots of parks to play.
[07:07.47]There are lots of opportunities to exercise
[07:10.27]and various forms of recreation.
[07:13.34]W: Wow, sounds like a nice place to live in.
[07:18.21]Questions 9 to 12 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[07:23.81]9. Where does the man come from?
[07:42.26]10. What do we learn about Brentwood?
[08:00.99]11. Which is one of the reasons for the high costs of Brentwood?
[08:21.01]12. What can be inferred from the conversation
[08:24.93]about the recreation in Brentwood?
[08:42.46]Conversation Two
[08:44.38]W: Hey, Mark, could you tell me about the first job you ever had?
[08:49.06]M: When I was at university,
[08:50.90]I used to work for 12 hours from 6 p.m. until 6 a.m.
[08:55.51]in a printing factory one night a week.
[08:58.71]W: So you worked from 6 p.m. until 6 a.m.?
[09:02.34]M: Yep, overnight.
[09:04.30]I feel that it is better to work just one long block of time
[09:08.25]rather than have a part-time job 2 or 3 nights a week.
[09:12.77]W: So for this job what exactly did you do?
[09:16.02]What were your duties?
[09:18.08]M: We took the TV guides from the printing presses
[09:20.78]and bundled them up to get them ready for distribution
[09:23.66]to the various convenience stores,gas stands
[09:26.66]and bookstores throughout the whole country.
[09:29.61]We also had to make sure that the shops and regions
[09:32.73]got the right number of guides.
[09:35.30]W: So a job like that would be manual labor,
[09:38.34]and sometimes it is very hard,right?
[09:41.40]I wonder what attracted you most in the job.
[09:44.65]M: Because of the hours we all worked overnight,
[09:47.79]there was a combination of other university students.
[09:51.10]We used to enjoy a good laugh while we were doing the work as well,
[09:54.80]and we really had quite a good team.
[09:57.79]W: Sounds fun to make so many lovely friends while you are working.
[10:01.90]M: Yes, though the job is tiring,
[10:04.40]it was really a wonderful experience to work with so many great guys.
[10:10.48]Questions 13 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[10:17.12]13. What was the man¡¯s first job?
[10:36.19]14. What were the man¡¯s duties for his first job?
[10:55.92]15. What does the man think of his first job?
[11:16.28]Section B
[11:17.83]Directions: In this section,
[11:20.64]you will hear 3 short passages.
[11:23.78]At the end of each passage,
[11:26.05]you will hear some questions.
[11:28.37]Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once.
[11:33.93]After you hear a question,
[11:35.94]you must choose the best answer from the four choices 
[11:40.16]marked A),B), C) and D).
[11:45.36]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[11:49.46]with a single line through the centre.
[11:52.58]Passage One
[11:54.25]It is what failed dieters have long suspected:
[11:58.33]Fat people really can¡¯t keep the weight off.
[12:02.18]Scientists have confirmed that the majority of overweight people
[12:05.70]who try to lose weight either by cutting calories or exercising
[12:10.58]will return to their former size.
[12:13.94]Fewer than 10 percent of the 12 million Britons who go on a diet each year
[12:19.84]succeed in losing significant amounts of weight
[12:22.96]and most of those who do put it all back on again within a year.
[12:28.13]The scientists, 
[12:29.14]from the Medical Research Council¡¯s National Survey of Health
[12:32.62]and Development,followed 5362 men and women from their birth in 1946
[12:40.77]and 20 000 from birth in 1958,measuring their weight and blood pressure
[12:47.43]and assessing their lifestyles.
[12:49.29]They found both groups began gaining weight in the 1980s
[12:53.83]and had steadily increased in size ever since.
[12:57.73]Dr. Rebecca Hardy, the council¡¯s program leader on body size,
[13:02.46]said, ¡°Once people become overweight,
[13:05.59]they continue relentlessly upwards.
[13:09.25]They hardly ever go back down.
[13:11.87]It is better to avoid getting fat in the first place.
[13:16.16]For men, weight goes up steadily through life.
[13:20.26]For women, it starts slowly and accelerates in the mid-thirties.¡±
[13:25.09]Experts have suggested evolution means
[13:28.11]we are programmed to put on weight rather than lose it.
[13:32.24]Dieting can make this tendency worse as decreasing calorie intake triggers
[13:37.87]the body to go into starvation mode
[13:40.21]and reduce the amount of energy it naturally expends,
[13:44.26]making it even harder to lose weight.
[13:47.51]But the study¡¯s findings do not mean dieting is pointless,
[13:51.45]as eating less and taking more exercise
[13:54.33]can increase fitness and lower blood pressure.
[13:59.22]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[14:04.56]16. What have the failed dieters suspected?
[14:24.20]17. What do scientists find after the long-time observation?
[14:44.93]18. What role does dieting play in losing weight 
[14:49.43]according to the passage?
[15:06.36]Passage Two
[15:07.82]A common challenge for many teachers
[15:10.31]is keeping their students focused in class.
[15:13.61]After all, many children can become distracted,
[15:17.61]bored or confused in a classroom setting,
[15:20.86]or abandon their concentration on a lesson plan.
[15:24.40]There are various ways teachers can encourage their students
[15:27.54]to stay focused and make learning more interesting.
[15:31.46]Based on a lack of students¡¯ focus,
[15:33.95]teachers are sometimes given the impression
[15:36.55]that their lesson plan is not motivating
[15:39.32]or interesting to their students.
[15:42.26]However, the problem might simply be that 
[15:45.26]the students need change and movement.
[15:48.44]It often helps for teachers to alternate quiet activities in class
[15:52.94]with more active and exciting lessons.
[15:56.48]Something changing the pace of your lessons and activities
[16:00.25]can make all the difference in helping your students stay focused,
[16:04.48]and ultimately enjoy the lesson you¡¯ve prepared for them.
[16:08.12]Children tend to remain more focused
[16:10.63]when interactive teaching tools are involved.
[16:14.12]For instance, an interactive whiteboard in the classroom
[16:17.30]can help children feel included,
[16:19.75]and thus stay more focused.
[16:22.34]What¡¯s more, it¡¯s an effective teaching tool,
[16:25.50]helping instructors enhance lesson plans and students learning.
[16:29.74]So remember, the slightest change in how you deliver your lesson plans
[16:34.09]can make a world of difference 
[16:35.65]when it comes to keeping your students focused.
[16:39.18]Above all£¬to reach the best effect in class,
[16:43.16]the first thing for teachers is to know the students¡¯ ability
[16:46.53]to maintain attention¡ªfor instance,based on their age group¡ª
[16:50.89]and enhance lessons accordingly for optimal focus and fun in the classroom.
[16:58.05]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[17:03.26]19. What should teachers do to make students enjoy the class?
[17:23.91]20. What is the function of the whiteboard in the class?
[17:43.55]21. What should teachers know first to reach the best effect in class?
[18:04.79]Passage Three
[18:06.69]A few degrees can make a big difference when it comes to food storage.
[18:11.51]Foods can go bad if they get too warm.
[18:14.61]But for many of the world¡¯s poor,
[18:16.88]finding a good way to keep food cool is difficult.
[18:21.03]Refrigerators are costly and they need electricity.
[18:24.91]Yet spoiled food not only creates health risks but also economic losses.
[18:31.22]Farmers lose money when they have to throw away products
[18:34.52]that they cannot sell quickly.
[18:37.08]But in 1995,a teacher in northern Nigeria
[18:41.03]named Mohammed Bah Abba found a solution.
[18:45.22]He developed the ¡°Pot-in-Pot Preservation¡± or ¡°Cooling System.¡±
[18:49.97]It uses two round containers made of clay.
[18:53.77]A smaller pot is placed inside a larger one.
[18:57.09]The space between the two pots is filled with wet sand.
[19:01.35]The inner pot can be filled with fruit,vegetables or drinks.
[19:05.63]A wet cloth covers the whole cooling system.
[19:09.01]Food in the smaller pot is kept from spoiling
[19:12.06]through a simple evaporation process.
[19:15.12]Water in the sand between the two pots evaporates
[19:18.56]through the surface of the larger pot,
[19:21.03]where drier outside air is moving.
[19:23.99]The evaporation process creates a drop in temperature of several degrees.
[19:29.09]This cools the inner pot and helps keep food safe from harmful bacteria.
[19:35.06]The invention became popular with farmers in other African countries.
[19:39.87]Mohammed Bah Abba personally financed the first 5 000 pot-in-pot systems
[19:45.28]for his own community and five villages nearby.
[19:50.05]In 2000, the Rolex Watch Company of Switzerland honored him
[19:54.60]with the Rolex Award for Enterprise.
[19:57.46]This award recognizes people trying to develop projects
[20:01.49]aimed at improving human knowledge and well-being.
[20:06.90]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[20:12.90]22. What is an important factor in food storage?
[20:32.84]23. Why does the speaker say spoiled food can create economic losses?
[20:54.40]24. How does the pot-in-pot system work?
[21:13.78]25. What can we learn about Mohammed Bah Abba?
[21:33.57]Section C
[21:34.95]Directions: In this section,
[21:37.59]you will hear a passage three times.
[21:40.55]When the passage is read for the first time,
[21:43.42]you should listen carefully for its general idea.
[21:47.41]When the passage is read for the second time,
[21:51.00]you are required to fill in the blanks
[21:53.55]with the exact words you have just heard.
[21:56.82]Finally, when the passage is read for the third time,
[22:01.14]you should check what you have written.
[22:04.01]Now listen to the passage.
[22:07.47]Coffee culture is a media term used to describe a social atmosphere
[22:12.56]that depends heavily upon coffee,
[22:15.03]espresso in particular,
[22:17.12]to act as a social lubricant.
[22:19.87]The term also refers to the diffusion and adoption of coffee
[22:24.55]as a widely consumed stimulant by a culture.
[22:27.92]The formation of culture around coffee and coffeehouses
[22:31.90]dates back to the 16th century in Turkey.
[22:35.33]Coffeehouses were traditionally social hubs,
[22:38.70]as well as artistic and intellectual centers.
[22:42.07]For example, Les DeuxMagots in Paris,
[22:45.63]now a popular tourist attraction,
[22:47.77]was once associated with the intellectuals Jean Paul Sartre
[22:51.97]and Simone de Beauvoir.
[22:54.55]Coffeehouses in London became popular meeting places for artists
[22:58.38]and socialites in the 18th century.
[23:01.34]Trademarks of today¡¯s coffeehouses
[23:04.04]with slower-paced gourmet service,tasteful environments,
[23:07.43]and social outlets have their origins in early coffeehouses
[23:11.50]and help to form the concept of coffee culture.
[23:15.81]The term is frequently used to 
[23:17.39]designate the presence of hundreds of espresso stands
[23:20.80]and coffee shops in the Seattle metropolitan area.
[23:25.50]In these places,
[23:26.99]there are a lot of franchises of businesses
[23:29.22]such as Starbucks and their clones 
[23:31.21]across the United States and much of the world.
[23:34.89]Additionally, the term is found frequently in print media
[23:38.66]to describe the deep impact of the market penetration of coffeehouses.
[23:43.38]It is not unusual to see several espresso shops
[23:46.93]and stands within walking distance of each other
[23:50.05]or on opposite corners of the same intersection,
[23:53.66]typically with customers overflowing into parking lots.
[23:58.04]Other aspects of coffee culture include
[24:00.99]the presence of free wireless Internet access for customers.
[24:05.08]Many of the customers do business 
[24:07.23]in these locations for hours on a regular basis.
[24:12.97]Now the passage will be read again.
