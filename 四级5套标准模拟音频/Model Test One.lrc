[00:15.74]Model Test One
[00:17.47]Part ¢ò Listening Comprehension
[00:20.48]Section A
[00:22.53]Directions: In this section,
[00:25.10]you will hear 8 short conversations
[00:27.53]and 2 long conversations.
[00:30.32]At the end of each conversation,
[00:32.42]one or more questions will be asked
[00:34.69]about what was said.
[00:36.41]Both the conversation and the questions
[00:38.87]will be spoken only once.
[00:41.34]After each question there will be a pause.
[00:44.41]During the pause,
[00:45.64]you must read the four choices marked A), B), C) and D),
[00:50.83]and decide which is the best answer.
[00:53.60]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:57.58]with a single line through the centre.
[01:00.59]Now let¡¯s begin with the eight short conversations.
[01:05.27]1. M: I passed by the street in front of our college yesterday.
[01:11.37]Do you remember the street we used to go to
[01:13.83]pick up some cheap goods?
[01:15.76]W: Yeah, the street was very crowded then,
[01:18.79]and many students liked to go there.
[01:21.54]What is it like now?
[01:23.61]Q: What does the woman remember of the street?
[01:41.94]2. W: If you have any clothes to wash,
[01:46.42]just put it in the closet behind the door,
[01:49.72]the laundrywoman will pick them up in the morning.
[01:53.69]M: OK, thanks.
[01:55.33]It sounds like I can have a great time here.
[01:58.17]And remember to bring me the remote control,please.
[02:01.84]Q: Where does the conversation most probably take place?
[02:22.06]3. M: I heard that you moved to the new apartment.
[02:26.25]What about the books you have collected for ten years?
[02:30.09]W: I sold some of them,
[02:32.07]so I can have more room to put in my newly-bought ones.
[02:36.75]Q: What does the woman mean?
[02:53.97]4. W: You have promised Tom that you will take him
[02:58.73]to the zoo this weekend.
[03:00.70]He will be back in half an hour.
[03:03.28]It¡¯s time you fulfilled your promise.
[03:06.53]M: I almost forget about it.
[03:08.81]I will fuel the car after I finish this report.
[03:12.78]Q: What is the man probably going to do first?
[03:31.57]5. M: The traffic report on the radio says that the congestion
[03:35.85]is going to be really bad.
[03:38.81]Don¡¯t you think we should go another way to avoid it?
[03:42.11]W: But that¡¯s the only way to the airport,isn¡¯t it?
[03:46.32]Unless we leave early,there is nothing we can do.
[03:50.55]Q: What does the woman mean?
[04:07.77]6. W: What would you do if you were in my shoes?
[04:13.42]M: If I worked for your boss,
[04:15.17]I wouldn¡¯t get myself into the trouble of
[04:17.28]interfering into her own business.
[04:19.94]After all, she can talk to her husband.
[04:23.55]Q: What does the man suggest the woman do?
[04:41.49]7. M: You got a new haircut.
[04:45.01]Now you look pretty cool.
[04:47.25]My sister always wants to have the same hairstyle.
[04:51.38]W: Really?
[04:52.22]No wonder so many people stared at me in the bus.
[04:57.25]Q: What do we learn from the conversation?
[05:14.94]8. W: Hey, John, here¡¯s a message for you.
[05:18.97]A man called you and asked for a leave.
[05:23.13]M: The operator in our company must have confused me
[05:25.87]with the other John in the Sales Department.
[05:29.46]Q: What do we learn about the man from the conversation?
[05:48.21]Now you will hear the two long conversations.
[05:55.65]Conversation One
[05:57.87]M: Hello! You seem worried. Can I help you?
[06:01.93]W: Oh, I feel so strange with my feet in the skis.
[06:07.25]M: So you don¡¯t know how to ski.
[06:09.71]Is it your first time coming here to ski?
[06:12.55]W: Actually, it¡¯s my first time seeing real white snow.
[06:17.39]M: Are you kidding? Where are you from,young lady?
[06:21.30]W: I used to live in Singapore. We do not have snow there.
[06:25.88]It¡¯s always sunny.
[06:27.53]M: No wonder.
[06:28.79]I guess you must be a good swimmer.
[06:31.33]W: You bet.
[06:32.44]Swimming is my favorite hobby.
[06:34.95]But I simply don¡¯t know what to do with these skis.
[06:39.24]M: Don¡¯t worry. I¡¯m sure you will learn it very quickly.
[06:43.28]I¡¯ll show you how to move. Now walk like me,all right?
[06:51.17]Good! Let¡¯s go up the hill and try once,shall we?
[06:53.15]When you want to go up the slope,
[06:55.49]you should stand sideways and go up step by step,
[06:59.57]just like a crab.
[07:01.50]W: Oh, that¡¯s really funny. I¡¯ve never walked in this way,
[07:06.09]but it¡¯s interesting.
[07:08.04]M: Let¡¯s move to the gentle slope.
[07:10.79]It will make it easier.
[07:12.16]W: I guess I¡¯m a little nervous.
[07:14.29]M: Take it easy. Trust yourself.
[07:16.82]Now, keep leaning forward while going down.
[07:20.39]If you want to stop,
[07:21.97]you should point the tips together,got it?
[07:25.13]W: I see.
[07:26.16]M: Now, let¡¯s try.OK. Go! How do you feel? Still afraid?
[07:33.17]W: No, not at all.
[07:34.76]As a matter of fact,
[07:36.24]I feel quite pleased and proud of myself,
[07:39.43]thank you very much. You are so kind.
[07:43.97]Questions 9 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[07:49.93]9.Why does the woman know nothing about skiing?
[08:10.20]10.What does the man suggest the woman do when going up the slope?
[08:30.64]11.What should the woman do if she wants to stop when skiing?
[08:51.41]Conversation Two
[08:53.49]M: Hi, Monica, please come in and take a seat.
[08:57.22]W: Well, you would like to talk about the new web designer with me,right?
[09:02.87]M: Yes, well, how does she perform?
[09:06.21]W: Well, that depends... she is very hardworking,
[09:10.35]but it seems that she often can¡¯t meet our expectations.
[09:14.51]For example, she was assigned to build the BBS the other day,
[09:19.67]but it seemed that she was not as good as what we had thought before.
[09:24.01]She told me just now that she could not complete that task.
[09:28.39]M: Well, didn¡¯t you talk with her about
[09:30.25]what she should do at the beginning?
[09:33.14]W: Not really.
[09:34.61]She was recommended by John and from what he told me,
[09:38.43]she sounded to be pretty qualified to do the job.
[09:42.20]I¡¯m not asking for a terrific web design
[09:45.62]but to build up a structure with all the basic elements of web design.
[09:50.89]M: Did you ask her why she wasn¡¯t frank with you
[09:54.08]in the beginning if she couldn¡¯t do the BBS£¿
[09:57.49]W: Well, from what she said,she learned that all by herself,
[10:01.82]and had no professional training.
[10:04.79]M: So now what do you plan to do since she got the job half done?
[10:09.87]W: On the one side,
[10:11.36]we can ask her to leave in a week since she was not honest
[10:14.93]when applying for the job and made so many mistakes.
[10:18.64]On the other side,
[10:19.92]we will have to hire someone with experience in that field
[10:22.68]to take over her job.
[10:24.99]M: Yes, I agree.
[10:26.77]That should also teach her a lesson.
[10:29.22]For us, I think we had better turn to our Job Center for help.
[10:33.95]There, we can get a professional to work at it.
[10:38.83]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[10:44.86]12. How does the new web designer perform according to the woman?
[11:05.68]13. What kind of job is the web designer required to do?
[11:25.99]14. What can we learn about the new web designer?
[11:46.09]15. What will they do with the new web designer?
[12:05.85]Section B
[12:07.38]Directions: In this section,
[12:10.02]you will hear 3 short passages.
[12:13.37]At the end of each passage,
[12:15.46]you will hear some questions.
[12:17.87]Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once.
[12:23.32]After you hear a question,
[12:25.54]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[12:29.42]marked A),B), C) and D).
[12:34.99]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[12:39.01]with a single line through the centre.
[12:43.18]Passage One
[12:45.07]Say you get into bed,
[12:46.92]prepared for a healthy seven or eight hours
[12:50.37]and then stare at the clock for four of them. Is all lost?
[12:55.79]If you have trouble sleeping for a few days here and there,
[12:59.63]taking steps to improve your sleep should get you back on track.
[13:04.30]The first step for anyone with sleep problems
[13:07.51]should be to take a careful look at your sleep hygiene.
[13:11.71]This means organizing your surroundings
[13:14.45]and activities to promote sleep as bedtime approaches.
[13:19.55]Skip caffeine after noon.
[13:22.36]Avoid alcohol or heavy meals within three hours of bedtime.
[13:27.93]Exercise is great for sleep,
[13:30.74]especially falling asleep.
[13:33.11]You¡¯ll get the most benefit by exercising one
[13:36.20]or two hours before bedtime.
[13:39.38]A hot shower or bath about an hour and a half
[13:43.08]before bedtime can also be helpful.
[13:46.66]In addition, reserve your bed for sleep.
[13:50.28]If you can¡¯t sleep,get out of bed,go somewhere else,
[13:54.71]do something quiet,calm and relaxing,
[13:58.16]go back to bed when you¡¯re sleepy again.
[14:01.55]Go to bed and wake up at the same time
[14:04.26]¡ªwithin a half hour¡ªevery day.
[14:08.01]Finally, don¡¯t make your Facebook page,
[14:11.58]BlackBerry or TV your final destination of the evening.
[14:16.17]Using these devices for communication
[14:19.05]is clearly eating into our sleep time.
[14:22.56]Texting friends, playing computer games or just watching TV
[14:27.76]stimulates our brains and bodies,
[14:30.88]and the extra light we expose ourselves to
[14:34.09]when we peer at a screen could be throwing off our body clocks.
[14:40.51]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[14:46.87]16. Which of the following is helpful for
[14:51.28]falling asleep according to the passage?
[15:09.40]17. What should we do if we cannot fall asleep according to the passage?
[15:30.72]18. Which is the best title for this passage?
[15:51.31]Passage Two
[15:52.52]Amanda La Munyon lives in Oklahoma.
[15:56.02]She is 14 years old.
[15:58.47]She had been having trouble at school.
[16:01.13]Her teachers said the little girl knew all the rules
[16:04.47]but could not seem to follow them.
[16:07.17]Then, Amanda says,
[16:08.62]art changed her life.
[16:10.99]When she started painting,
[16:12.74]she discovered she could express herself with color and canvas.
[16:17.59]Her art teacher discovered that Amanda had great skill.
[16:21.92]Amanda created a Web site to sell her art.
[16:25.86]She donates the earnings to organizations that help sick children.
[16:30.90]Amanda says she does not want children to ever give up
[16:35.70]because they do not know what they can do until they try.
[16:40.73]Zach Bonner knows just how far trying can get you.
[16:45.80]Earlier this month,
[16:48.16]the 11-year-old boy completed his biggest charity project to date.
[16:52.67]He walked almost 2 000 kilometers from his home in Florida to Washington,
[16:59.77]DC, to raise money for homeless children in America.
[17:02.86]He called his project ¡°From My House to the White House.¡±
[17:07.46]He carried a message to President Obama and lawmakers.
[17:11.00]He asked for help for the more than
[17:12.53]one million homeless children in the United States.
[17:16.75]The walk raised tens of thousands of dollars for Zach¡¯s cause.
[17:22.07]His mother says Zach has always enjoyed community service work.
[17:26.25]She says it began when Hurricane Charley hit Florida in 2004.
[17:31.71]Zach decided to help victims by walking around his area
[17:35.81]with his little red wagon collecting and giving out bottles of water.
[17:40.63]He got the nickname ¡°Little Red Wagon Boy.¡±
[17:45.47]Questions 19 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[17:51.31]19. Why did Amanda say that art changed her life?
[18:12.05]20. What did Amanda do with the money that she got from selling her art?
[18:32.59]21. What¡¯s the result of Zach¡¯s project
[18:36.18]¡°From My House to the White House¡±?
[18:54.44]22. How did Zach get the nickname ¡°Little Red Wagon Boy¡±?
[19:15.16]Passage Three
[19:16.95]The injury to the brain caused by a blow happens when the brain is shaken,
[19:22.18]often in a car crash or a fall or a strike to the head in sports.
[19:27.22]It can be mild,
[19:28.87]but doctors may order a CT scan to look for a more serious injury.
[19:34.27]Computed X-rays provide a detailed image of the brain.
[19:38.75]But a recent study warned that more children than necessary
[19:42.61]are being exposed radiation to this way.
[19:46.15]A national team led by two doctors at the University of California,
[19:50.78]Davis, studied hospital records
[19:53.30]from thousands of children with head injuries.
[19:56.53]They found that in many cases,
[19:59.66]the risk of developing cancer from the radiation
[20:02.07]outweighed the risk of a serious brain injury.
[20:05.69]The study found that one in five children over age two
[20:10.09]had a low risk of serious injury but received CT scans anyway.
[20:15.95]The same was true of almost one in four children under age two.
[20:20.92]The researchers have developed rules to predict
[20:23.68]if a head injury is serious enough for a scan.
[20:27.59]For children under two,
[20:29.49]doctors are advised against it if there is: normal mental activity,
[20:34.56]no swelling in the back of the head,
[20:37.13]no feeling of a broken bone in the skull,
[20:40.06]and no loss of consciousness for more than five seconds.
[20:45.01]Doctors should also consider how the child was injured
[20:48.73]and whether the parents say the child is acting normally.
[20:52.95]For patients from two to eighteen,
[20:55.86]the guidelines are similar
[20:57.41]¡ªexcept there should be no loss of consciousness,
[20:59.85]no vomiting and no severe headache.
[21:05.69]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[21:12.14]23. What¡¯s the new discovery about the CT scan?
[21:33.26]24. What did the national team find after studying records from
[21:38.93]children with head injuries?
[21:56.55]25. When can a child be given a CT scan?
[22:16.79]Section C
[22:18.29]Directions: In this section,
[22:20.97]you will hear a passage three times.
[22:24.08]When the passage is read for the first time,
[22:26.96]you should listen carefully for its general idea.
[22:30.91]When the passage is read for the second time,
[22:34.16]you are required to fill in the blanks with the exact words
[22:38.28]you have just heard.
[22:40.24]Finally, when the passage is read for the third time,
[22:44.59]you should check what you have written.
[22:47.70]Now listen to the passage.
[22:50.62]Disappointment, as uncomfortable and even painful as it can be for us,
[22:55.65]is essential and important on our journey of growth.
[22:59.71]Making peace with disappointing others
[23:02.01]allows us to release our erroneous demands for perfection.
[23:06.28]Letting go of our fear of being disappointed gives us the ability
[23:10.96]to take more risks and ask for what we truly want.
[23:15.71]When we¡¯re able to embrace disappointment,
[23:18.07]we create a sense of liberation and space
[23:20.30]that frees us up to be who we truly are
[23:24.05]and let go of our attachment with others¡¯ opinions.
[23:27.77]This is not always easy,
[23:29.73]but is so powerful and can be transformational.
[23:34.06]Here are a few things you can consider and do
[23:37.11]to expand your capacity to embrace disappointment:
[23:41.39]First, take inventory.
[23:43.70]Take an honest look at some of the most important relationships
[23:46.70]and activities in your life.
[23:49.45]How many of your actions,thoughts, conversations have to do
[23:53.78]with your avoidance of disappointing others or being disappointed?
[23:58.71]Second, practice saying ¡°no.¡± This is a great practice,
[24:03.43]especially for those ¡°people pleasers¡±
[24:06.23]who find themselves saying ¡°yes¡± to stuff they don¡¯t really want to do.
[24:11.35]While there is great value in being someone
[24:13.60]who is willing to say ¡°yes¡± in life,
[24:16.57]there is also power in owning our ¡°no¡± as well.
[24:21.02]Third, expand and express your desires.
[24:24.37]Make a list of some of the most important and vulnerable desires
[24:28.62]you currently have¡ªthe things you really want,
[24:32.27]but maybe have been afraid to admit.
[24:35.02]When you allow yourself to express your authentic desires,
[24:38.88]you give yourself the freedom to ask,
[24:41.58]dream and create.
[24:45.63]Now the passage will be read again.
[24:50.10]Disappointment, as uncomfortable and even painful as it can be for us,

[24:59.65]Making peace with disappointing others
