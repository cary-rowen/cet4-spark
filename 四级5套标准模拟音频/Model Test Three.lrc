[00:18.24]Model Test Three
[00:19.93]Part ¢ò Listening Comprehension
[00:22.75]Section A
[00:24.64]Directions: In this section,
[00:27.34]you will hear 8 short conversations and 2 long conversations.
[00:32.72]At the end of each conversation,
[00:34.79]one or more questions will be asked about what was said.
[00:38.31]Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once.
[00:43.67]After each question there will be a pause.
[00:46.72]During the pause,
[00:47.75]you must read the four choices marked A),B), C) and D),
[00:53.33]and decide which is the best answer.
[00:55.96]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:59.88]with a single line through the centre.
[01:02.76]Now let¡¯s begin with the eight short conversations.
[01:07.29]1. M: Angela is late again.
[01:11.22]She says her landlady isn¡¯t feeling well
[01:13.98]and she has to take her to the hospital before coming to work.
[01:17.75]W: Whatever! She always has excuses for being late
[01:21.53]and I¡¯m not buying any one of the stories anymore.
[01:25.31]Q: What does the woman mean?
[01:42.21]2. W: Did you have a good time at the party last night?
[01:46.78]M: The food looked nice but I didn¡¯t get a chance to taste it.
[01:50.57]It was so crowded and I couldn¡¯t even get close to
[01:53.88]where they were serving the food and drinks.
[01:56.95]Q: What can we learn about the party?
[02:14.38]3. M: The new mayor is really a good public speaker.
[02:19.41]The speech he delivered last night on TV was excellent.
[02:23.46]W: I was so tired that I dozed off even before the speech started.
[02:28.78]Q: What can we learn about the woman?
[02:46.15]4. W: Justin and I are going fishing.
[02:50.03]Are you coming with us?
[02:52.16]M: Fishing is not my type of sport.
[02:54.14]I¡¯d rather go climbing.
[02:56.11]I¡¯ll meet you guys here at the camp after a couple of hours.
[03:00.17]Q: What is the man planning to do?
[03:17.85]5. W: I paid ¡ç300 just for the books this semester.
[03:23.54]That¡¯s unbelievable.
[03:25.65]M: The bookstore on the campus has some used textbooks on sale
[03:29.17]and I heard Joanna only paid ¡ç120.
[03:34.00]Q: What can we learn from the conversation?
[03:51.77]6. M: It¡¯s such a beautiful day!
[03:55.40]Let¡¯s go out and have a walk in the park.
[03:58.31]W: It¡¯s a good idea.
[03:59.89]Let¡¯s go to the convenience store and get some drinks and snacks first.
[04:05.56]Q: What will they probably do?
[04:22.74]7. M: The guy in the next apartment
[04:26.03]has been playing the trumpet for more than four hours
[04:29.04]and it¡¯s driving me crazy.
[04:31.44]W: He always keeps on making noises until after midnight.
[04:35.45]Do you think we should call the police?
[04:38.82]Q: Why does the woman want to call the police?
[04:56.77]8. W: Shall we go to the concert by car or by bus?
[05:01.91]M: I have checked the route on the Internet
[05:03.88]and the subway is the best choice.
[05:06.58]Both our home and the concert hall
[05:08.72]are only a few minutes¡¯ walk from the subway stations.
[05:12.22]Q: How will they go to the concert?
[05:29.18]Now you will hear the two long conversations.
[05:34.63]Conversation One
[05:36.92]M: Cindy, what is happiness in your mind?
[05:40.58]W: Why ask?
[05:41.91]It¡¯s a difficult question.
[05:44.28]Different people may have a different understanding of happiness.
[05:48.48]M: You said it.
[05:49.86]But that is the assignment from my psychology professor.
[05:53.76]W: Well, in my mind,
[05:55.56]happiness is supposed to be just a state of mind,
[05:59.52]not so closely related to material life.
[06:02.68]M: OK.
[06:03.54]A state of mind.
[06:05.12]Anything else?
[06:07.20]W: People ought to value what they already have got.
[06:10.76]They shouldn¡¯t always feel sorry for what they can¡¯t have.
[06:14.23]M: Yes, I agree.
[06:15.98]But many people often get used to what they have
[06:19.01]and don¡¯t cherish them anymore.
[06:21.58]W: You are right.
[06:22.94]Maybe people can¡¯t be very happy by only staying at one place
[06:27.38]or staying still at one condition.
[06:30.43]I mean, if people get what they dream about,
[06:33.23]or they do better than they expected,
[06:35.77]they feel happy.
[06:36.97]And...
[06:37.69]M: Hold it a second.
[06:38.81]I need to write what you have said down.
[06:41.73]Get what they dream about...better than expected.
[06:45.95]All right.
[06:46.92]That¡¯s very helpful.
[06:48.31]Now, let¡¯s talk about what kind of specific things or conditions
[06:52.89]that can make people feel happy.
[06:55.29]Take you for example.
[06:57.09]W: Well, I said that I didn¡¯t mind material things a lot.
[07:01.36]But if I get some gifts very carefully chosen
[07:04.26]or made by my beloved relatives or friends,
[07:08.15]even though they may not be expensive,
[07:10.80]I would still be very happy.
[07:13.13]M: So do I.
[07:14.42]Do you feel this kind of happiness lasts long?
[07:18.06]W: Of course.
[07:19.32]Whenever I take out the things and look at them,
[07:22.29]I know there are people who care about me and love me.
[07:26.40]My heart will be full of happiness.
[07:31.47]Questions 9 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[07:38.95]9. What is Cindy¡¯s opinion on happiness?
[07:58.39]10. According to the man,
[08:01.12]why can¡¯t some people feel happy?
[08:18.82]11. What kind of gifts will make Cindy feel happy?
[08:38.49]Conversation Two
[08:40.34]W: Hello, this is Mary speaking.
[08:42.91]M: Hi, Mary.
[08:44.41]This is Owen.
[08:45.73]W: Ah, my dear editor.
[08:47.77]What¡¯s up?
[08:48.68]M: I am calling to tell you that the book you sent me
[08:51.40]has been approved to be published.
[08:54.09]W: Really?
[08:54.91]That¡¯s good news.
[08:56.23]I can¡¯t believe my ears.
[08:58.00]Since the day I put the manuscript into the post box,
[09:01.51]I have been counting the days.
[09:03.47]Am I daydreaming?
[09:04.88]Tell me, do you really think the book is good enough to be published?
[09:08.60]M: I have no doubt about it.
[09:10.54]And I am sure it¡¯s going to be a bestseller.
[09:14.09]W: Oh, I don¡¯t know what to say now.
[09:16.49]Thank you so much.
[09:18.65]When is it going to be published?
[09:20.64]M: Don¡¯t be in such a hurry.
[09:22.52]Before the publishing,
[09:24.02]we need to meet and there are some places
[09:26.63]that I feel can still be improved.
[09:28.90]W: No problem.
[09:30.02]I am looking forward to learning from you
[09:32.16]and getting some professional opinions.
[09:34.45]M: Oh, you are so polite and humble.
[09:37.07]I think we can have a discussion and learn from each other.
[09:40.48]W: How about tomorrow morning?
[09:42.38]I can go to your office.
[09:44.01]M: Oh, I¡¯m sorry.
[09:45.13]There is another call coming in.
[09:46.97]I have to hang up soon.
[09:48.84]Can you come here at about 9:30?
[09:51.58]W: All right.
[09:52.57]No problem.
[09:53.47]M: My secretary is going to call you to confirm the appointment.
[09:57.13]I hope to see you tomorrow.
[09:59.04]W: See you.
[10:00.99]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[10:07.49]12. What is the relationship between the two speakers?
[10:27.57]13. How does Mary feel when she gets the news from the man?
[10:48.17]14. What¡¯s the purpose of the man¡¯s calling?
[11:07.30]15. Why does the man have to hang up?
[11:26.62]Section B
[11:28.28]Directions: In this section,
[11:31.02]you will hear 3 short passages.
[11:33.96]At the end of each passage,
[11:36.47]you will hear some questions.
[11:38.45]Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once.
[11:44.30]After you hear a question,
[11:46.39]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[11:50.37]marked A), B), C) and D).
[11:55.56]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[11:59.91]with a single line through the centre.
[12:02.70]Passage One
[12:04.59]With the global economy now taking more executives
[12:07.81]to far-away places like Beijing and Tokyo,
[12:11.32]jet lag is becoming a bigger problem.
[12:15.11]Sleep researchers are working harder than
[12:17.02]ever to find suitable remedies.
[12:19.55]Trips to the other side of the globe
[12:21.97]make adjusting a traveler¡¯s body clock a more lasting process.
[12:26.84]Jet lag experts say they believe it
[12:30.08]takes one day for each time zone away from home,
[12:34.23]up to a maximum of six or seven days,
[12:37.76]to get fully in harmony with local time.
[12:40.67]Using a combination of nap and caffeine
[12:43.40]is better than using them separately,
[12:46.37]if you can believe it.
[12:47.81]It takes 15 to 30 minutes for caffeine to kick in.
[12:52.31]So you may do the two together.
[12:55.13]All it takes is a cup of coffee.
[12:57.77]By the time the caffeine is working,
[12:59.92]your nap is over.
[13:02.11]Sleep experts are also working with professional
[13:04.74]and amateur athletes who perform at international meets.
[13:09.51]A proper amount of sleep
[13:12.02]can improve an athlete¡¯s performance as much as 30%.
[13:15.58]But there is no easy remedy.
[13:17.89]The problem lies in the difference
[13:19.36]in travelers¡¯ ability to handle jet lag.
[13:23.46]Sleep researchers have found that people who
[13:25.84]have dealt with sleep loss over long periods
[13:28.93]can tolerate jet lag better than most.
[13:32.54]And older travelers also tend to get harder hit than the young by jet lag.
[13:40.44]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[13:46.02]16. What should we do to deal with jet lag according to the passage?
[14:07.06]17. How much improvement can a proper amount of sleep
[14:12.55]make to the athletes¡¯ performance?
[14:30.30]18. Which of the following group can tolerate jet lag better than others?
[14:51.55]Passage Two
[14:53.32]Experts in the food industry are thinking a lot about trash these days.
[14:58.43]Restaurants, colleges, hospitals and other institutions
[15:03.50]are trying to lower the costs of waste in new ways.
[15:07.90]Some are tracking their trash with software systems,
[15:11.22]making food in smaller amounts
[15:13.98]or trying to cut down on trash-hauling costs.
[15:18.13]Roughly 30% of food in the United States goes to waste,
[15:22.85]costing some ¡ç48 billion annually.
[15:27.13]A recent study estimated that 40 to 50 percent of food
[15:31.46]in the United States was wasted.
[15:34.06]Freshman students at Virginia Tech were surprised this year
[15:37.99]when they entered two of the campus¡¯s biggest dining halls
[15:41.53]to find there were no cafeteria trays.
[15:45.34]One student said without trays,
[15:47.86]students took less food and didn¡¯t eat more than they should.
[15:52.02]Getting rid of trays has cut food waste by 38% at the cafeterias.
[15:57.75]That same phenomenon often happens
[15:59.79]at Oregon¡¯s Portland International Airport.
[16:03.34]Busy travelers often throw half-eaten meals into trash cans
[16:07.42]and the airport must pay the city to haul the waste away.
[16:11.28]Now the airport is carrying out a program to install food-only trash cans.
[16:17.21]The food waste is collected and given to the city to use in agriculture.
[16:22.05]Besides being environmentally friendly,
[16:24.54]the changes may save the airport money.
[16:27.47]It costs about ¡ç82 to have one ton of trash hauled,
[16:32.42]but food waste costs only about ¡ç48 a ton to haul.
[16:37.63]Cutting back on the waste
[16:39.03]can require spending money on software and training.
[16:43.07]There are software systems that track food being thrown out.
[16:47.10]Steve Peterson is the head chef at the MGM Grand Hotel.
[16:51.96]He was surprised when he installed the software system
[16:55.13]and saw the value of food that was going out of the back door.
[16:59.17]To cut costs,
[17:00.45]Peterson decided to reduce serving sizes.
[17:05.24]Questions 19 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[17:11.57]19. What is the main aim for people paying attention to food waste?
[17:32.79]20. Why do the dining halls in Virginia Tech have no trays?
[17:53.55]21. What¡¯s the purpose of installing food-only trash cans at the airport?
[18:14.47]22. How can the software system help reduce the food waste?
[18:35.38]Passage Three
[18:37.02]Have you ever been afraid to talk back when you were treated unfairly?
[18:41.60]Have you ever bought something just because
[18:43.60]the salesman talked you into it?
[18:46.37]Are you afraid to ask someone for a date?
[18:49.43]Many people are afraid to assert themselves.
[18:52.89]Dr. Robert Alberti, author of ¡°Stand Up,
[18:56.15]Speak Out,and Talk Back,¡± thinks it¡¯s because their self-respect is low.
[19:02.26]¡°There¡¯s always a ¡®superior¡¯ around: a parent,a teacher,
[19:05.90]a boss who ¡®knows better.¡¯¡±  But Alberti and other scientists
[19:10.30]are doing something to help people assert themselves.
[19:13.73]They offer ¡°Assertiveness Training¡±  courses.
[19:17.27]In the AT courses people learn that they have a right to be themselves.
[19:22.23]They learn to speak out and feel good about doing so.
[19:26.23]They learn to be aggressive without hurting other people.
[19:29.87]In one way,
[19:30.78]learning to speak out is to overcome fear.
[19:34.31]A group taking an AT course will help the timid person to lose his fear.
[19:39.66]It uses an even stronger motive¡ªthe need to share.
[19:43.98]The timid person speaks out in the group
[19:45.75]because he wants to tell how he feels.
[19:49.47]Whether or not you speak up for yourself depends on your self-image.
[19:54.05]If someone you face is more ¡°important¡±  than you,
[19:57.47]you may start to doubt your own good sense.
[20:00.75]But why should you?
[20:02.26]AT says you can get to feel good about yourself.
[20:06.13]And once you do,
[20:07.45]you can learn to speak out.
[20:11.08]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[20:17.63]23. What is the problem the speaker mainly talks about?
[20:37.89]24. What is suggested to the timid persons to overcome their problems?
[20:59.39]25. What is the content of an AT course?
[21:18.32]Section C
[21:20.02]Directions: In this section,
[21:22.64]you will hear a passage three times.
[21:25.71]When the passage is read for the first time,
[21:28.81]you should listen carefully for its general idea.
[21:32.59]When the passage is read for the second time,
[21:36.01]you are required to fill in the blanks
[21:38.24]with the exact words you have just heard.
[21:41.79]Finally, when the passage is read for the third time,
[21:46.17]you should check what you have written.
[21:49.17]Now listen to the passage.
[21:53.10]West Point is a college for future Army officers.
[21:56.77]It has more than 4 000 students called cadets.
[22:00.63]The school is located about 80 kilometers north of New York City.
[22:05.16]West Point is the oldest continuously occupied military post
[22:09.16]in the United States.
[22:11.56]General George Washington built a fort there during the Revolutionary War
[22:16.16]to protect the Hudson River from the British.
[22:19.59]He moved his headquarters to West Point in 1779 during the war.
[22:25.14]In 1802, President Thomas Jefferson signed legislation
[22:30.04]to establish the military academy.
[22:32.90]The education centered on engineering.
[22:35.80]West Point graduates designed many roads,
[22:38.81]bridges, harbors and railways for the young nation.
[22:42.75]Today, math and science are still a large part of the education.
[22:47.49]But cadets can choose from almost 50 areas of study.
[22:51.81]If cadets major in the humanities,
[22:54.20]they must have an engineering minor.
[22:56.93]Not all the young men and women at West Point are American.
[23:01.48]Up to 60 cadets can be international students this year.
[23:05.74]International students are nominated by their governments.
[23:09.50]They must satisfy physical and educational requirements
[23:13.42]and do well on the Test of English as a Foreign Language.
[23:17.70]After graduation, they return home to serve in their nation¡¯s armed forces.
[23:22.99]Other services besides the Army also accept foreign students
[23:26.80]at their academies.
[23:29.24]Major Joe Sowers,
[23:31.18]a West Point public affairs officer,
[23:33.33]says information is available through American embassies,
[23:37.05]and the presence of international students
[23:39.37]at West Point serves a purpose for the Army.
[23:43.32]Now the passage will be read again.
[23:46.66]West Point is a college for future Army officers.
[23:50.47]It has more than 4 000 students called cadets.
[23:54.18]The school is located about 80 kilometers north of New York City.
