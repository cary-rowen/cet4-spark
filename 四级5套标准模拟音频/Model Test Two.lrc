[00:20.50]Part ¢ò Listening Comprehension
[00:23.50]Section A
[00:25.44]Directions:  In this section,
[00:28.08]you will hear 8 short conversations and 2 long conversations.
[00:33.36]At the end of each conversation,
[00:35.39]one or more questions will be asked about what was said.
[00:39.16]Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once.
[00:44.30]After each question there will be a pause.
[00:47.32]During the pause,
[00:48.64]you must read the four choices marked A),B), C) and D),
[00:53.74]and decide which is the best answer.
[00:56.75]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[01:00.57]with a single line through the centre.
[01:03.50]Now let¡¯s begin with the eight short conversations.
[01:08.40]1. M: Linda, why do you need my notes?
[01:13.01]I remember seeing you in Prof. Bush¡¯s lecture.
[01:17.21]W: It was the flu.
[01:18.67]I could hardly pay attention.
[01:20.80]Even the black coffee didn¡¯t work.
[01:24.20]Q: What can we learn from the conversation?
[01:41.79]2. W: I¡¯m so glad that Mr. Sullivan finally got us five million dollars 
[01:47.24]to save the business.
[01:49.36]M: I don¡¯t know how in the world he did it,
[01:52.00]but I sure take my hat off to him.
[01:55.13]Q:What¡¯s the man¡¯s attitude toward Mr. Sullivan?
[02:13.47]3.M: I¡¯m thinking about buying a new and more fashionable cell phone.
[02:19.47]This one is beginning to cause me headaches.
[02:22.91]W: It¡¯s really a durable one.
[02:25.05]I remember you bought it six years ago.
[02:27.83]Are you planning to buy a new one of the same brand£¿
[02:32.08]Q: What can we learn about the man¡¯s cell phone?
[02:50.45]4. W: Have you met John¡¯s girlfriend?
[02:54.03]Do you feel she¡¯s as glamorous and dazzling as he said?
[02:58.15]How come I don¡¯t feel so?
[03:00.60]M: Well, they say love is blind.
[03:03.92]Q: What does the man mean?
[03:21.26]5. M: Shall we go to see the movie this weekend?
[03:25.73]A good movie will be on show at the West Wood Theater.
[03:29.47]W: I have to hand in my report next Monday.
[03:32.79]And I heard the theater would give students a 50% discount on Tuesday.
[03:38.60]Q: When does the woman prefer to watch the movie?
[03:56.70]6. W: How was your trip to San Francisco?
[04:00.70]Did you get the contract done successfully?
[04:04.07]M: Well, except for the snow storm and the delayed flight,
[04:07.55]everything was fine.
[04:09.92]Q: What can we learn from the conversation?
[04:27.56]7. M: Can I have some ice for my whisky?
[04:32.75]W: Of course you can,Sir.
[04:34.71]But I should assure you that ice will definitely ruin the flavor.
[04:39.81]Q: Where does this conversation most probably take place?
[04:58.72]8. M: Ruth, don¡¯t move and stand right there.
[05:03.85]The background is very pretty and this will be a good shot.
[05:08.89]W: Hold it a second.
[05:10.41]I want to fix my hair a bit.
[05:13.16]Q: What are the two speakers doing?
[05:30.56]Now you will hear the two long conversations.
[05:37.05]Conversation One
[05:39.07]W: You look better today.
[05:40.94]How did your test go?
[05:42.69]M: Much better than it did yesterday.
[05:45.53]W: Did you pass?
[05:46.83]M: I not only passed it,
[05:48.40]but I got high marks! I¡¯m so happy!
[05:52.27]W: You should be.
[05:53.55]You worked really hard last night preparing for it.
[05:57.12]M: Thank you for helping me with it.
[05:59.10]If you hadn¡¯t encouraged me to do my best,
[06:02.31]I wouldn¡¯t have ever been able to pass.
[06:05.33]W: You don¡¯t have to thank me.
[06:07.25]It¡¯s just a part of my job as your counselor.
[06:10.95]M: Did you always do well in high school?
[06:14.12]W: No, in fact,I was terrible at taking exams.
[06:18.74]M: Really?
[06:19.87]W: Sure, but my teachers always encouraged me to do the best
[06:24.35]and that helped me a lot.
[06:26.23]By the way,when are your final exams?
[06:29.72]M: In about two months.
[06:32.35]W: When do you plan to prepare for those exams?
[06:35.85]M: Well, most students just cram the night before.
[06:39.87]W: Do you think that¡¯s a good idea?
[06:42.55]M: No, I think I should study a little bit at a time,
[06:45.97]starting a few weeks before the exam.
[06:48.95]W: That sounds like a good idea.
[06:50.91]What are you going to do if you have any questions while you¡¯re studying?
[06:55.21]M: I¡¯ll go and talk to my professor or a learning support assistant.
[06:59.99]W: Sounds like you¡¯ve learned something useful this year!
[07:04.94]Questions 9 to 12 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[07:09.78]9.  Why does the man look so happy today?
[07:29.08]10. When do most students prepare for exams according to the man?
[07:50.15]11. What will the man do if he has any questions during the study?
[08:11.22]12.What is the relationship between the two speakers?
[08:31.39]Conversation Two
[08:33.15]W: You don¡¯t look too well.
[08:35.00]Maybe you should take the day off from work.
[08:37.83]M: I couldn¡¯t do that.
[08:39.23]I have an important meeting to go to today.
[08:42.72]W: Do you feel OK?
[08:44.38]M: Not really.
[08:45.85]After a 12-hour flight,I¡¯ve got jetlag,and on top of that,
[08:50.79]I think I¡¯ve also got the flu.
[08:54.17]W: Why don¡¯t you call your secretary
[08:56.24]and tell her to reschedule the meeting?
[08:59.20]You should really take a rest at home
[09:01.55]or you¡¯ll end up feeling even worse than you do now.
[09:05.08]M: Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever?
[09:10.28]W: You¡¯re really hot.
[09:11.60]Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down.
[09:15.15]M: OK. I¡¯ll stay at home this morning and take a rest,
[09:19.07]but if I feel better in the afternoon,
[09:21.76]I¡¯m going to the meeting.
[09:23.70]Now I¡¯ll call my secretary.
[09:26.60]W: Gosh, what¡¯s that on your arm?
[09:29.13]M: I don¡¯t know.
[09:30.76]It looks a bit red,
[09:32.30]but I¡¯m sure it¡¯s nothing.
[09:34.97]W: It looks like you have a red rash! Are you allergic to anything?
[09:39.53]M: Just cats, but I don¡¯t think I was near any cats 
[09:42.70]in the last couple of weeks.
[09:45.22]W: I completely forgot about your cat allergy.
[09:48.75]I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago.
[09:52.80]Oh no£¬we¡¯d better go to the doctor to get some medicine. Let¡¯s go.
[09:58.20]M: Shouldn¡¯t we make an appointment first?
[10:00.87]W: We should,but let¡¯s just go and see
[10:03.32]if there¡¯s an opening now before it gets worse.
[10:07.94]Questions 13 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[10:14.16]13. Why is the man unwilling to ask for a leave?
[10:34.38]14. What will the man call his secretary to do?
[10:53.96]15. Why does the man have a red rash£¿
[11:12.96]Section B
[11:14.56]Directions: In this section,
[11:17.21]you will hear 3 short passages.
[11:20.42]At the end of each passage,
[11:22.64]you will hear some questions.
[11:24.95]Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once.
[11:30.50]After you hear a question,
[11:32.65]you must choose the best answer
[11:35.42]from the four choices marked A),B), C) and D).
[11:42.02]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[11:46.15]with a single line through the centre.
[11:49.48]Passage One
[11:51.86]There is probably no area of human activities in which our values
[11:56.46]and lifestyles are reflected more vividly
[11:59.57]than they are in the clothes that we choose to wear.
[12:03.56]The dress of an individual is a kind of ¡°sign language¡±
[12:07.39]that communicates a complex set of information
[12:10.56]and is usually the basis on which immediate impressions are formed.
[12:15.62]Traditionally, a concern for clothes 
[12:18.02]was considered to be a feminine preoccupation,
[12:21.85]while men took pride in the fact 
[12:23.53]that they were completely lacking in clothes consciousness.
[12:28.07]Times has changed as masculine dress 
[12:30.84]takes on greater variety and color.
[12:34.46]As early as 1955,
[12:37.01]a research revealed that men attached high importance 
[12:40.24]to the value of clothing in daily life.
[12:43.80]White-collar workers in particular viewed dress 
[12:46.62]as a symbol capable of manipulation,
[12:50.09]which could be used to impress or influence others,
[12:53.76]especially in work situations.
[12:56.57]Although blue-collar workers were less aware
[12:59.47]that they might be judged on the basis of their clothing,
[13:02.82]they recognized that any difference 
[13:04.72]from the accepted pattern of dress
[13:07.90]would draw scoff from fellow workers.
[13:11.39]Since that time,
[13:12.49]the pattern has changed: 
[13:14.04]The typical office workers may now be wearing the blue shirt,
[13:18.22]and the laborers the white shirt; 
[13:20.58]but the importance of dress has not diminished.
[13:25.35]Questions 16 to 19 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[13:31.43]16. What can our clothes do according to the passage?
[13:52.14]17. What can we know about men in the past?
[14:12.01]18. What can we learn about blue-collar workers 
[14:15.96]according to the research of 1955?
[14:34.91]19. What is this passage mainly about?
[14:54.54]Passage Two
[14:56.05]Your co-workers have been gossiping less as of late,
[15:00.08]and that should have the old boss worried.
[15:03.15]Most workers¡ª63 percent,
[15:05.57]in fact¡ªsay that water cooler chit-chat 
[15:08.50]about their co-workers is commonplace,
[15:11.87]but that¡¯s down from four years ago
[15:14.24]when nearly 85 percent of companies said 
[15:16.94]that office gossip was a regular occurrence.
[15:21.11]The decline may be indicative of a pick-up in the larger economy,
[15:26.08]especially when compared to the reported boost in gossip and rumors
[15:30.67]about downsizing and layoffs as the economy worsened.
[15:35.33]Since the depths of the financial crisis,
[15:38.84]corporate profits have racked up a couple all-time highs
[15:42.60]and hiring has seen a slight increase,
[15:45.52]perhaps alleviating some workplace pressure.
[15:48.38]Yet a drop in office gossip may actually be harming,not helping,
[15:53.01]worker productivity.
[15:55.83]When it focuses on general rumors instead of malicious tidbits,
[16:00.02]office gossip can actually help workers bond during a time of anxiety.
[16:05.93]If employees bond enough,
[16:08.07]it could get them to hang out outside the office,
[16:11.45]an additional productivity boost.
[16:13.97]More than half of supervisors say co-workers¡¯ doubling as friends
[16:19.50]outside of the office has a positive impact on the workplace,
[16:23.36]the Times of India reports.
[16:25.53]In addition, workers may have to engage 
[16:28.07]in some office chit-chat to be successful at a company.
[16:32.81]Nearly 60 percent of workers said 
[16:35.27]getting involved in office politics is necessary to get ahead,
[16:40.08]according to a survey from Robert Half International,
[16:43.65]a finance and accounting firm.
[16:47.15]Questions 20 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[16:52.80]20. What can be inferred about office gossip?
[17:12.80]21. What is the probable relationship between gossip and economy?
[17:34.20]22. What benefit can office gossip bring?
[17:53.52]Passage Three
[17:55.17]Before refrigerators were invented,
[17:57.45]the next best thing was an ice box.
[18:00.76]But another way to keep foods fresh is to use an evaporative cooler.
[18:05.96]A common design is a tall box with several shelves inside to hold the foods.
[18:11.70]The shelves are pieces of metal with many small holes through them.
[18:16.37]The sides of the box are covered with pieces of thick cloth.
[18:20.48]Containers of water are placed at the top and bottom of the cooler.
[18:24.92]The ends of each piece of cloth lie in the water so the cloth stays wet.
[18:30.28]The cooler is put outdoors,but not in the sun.
[18:34.07]Air will pass through the wet cloth.
[18:36.68]The inside of the box will stay several degrees cooler
[18:40.35]than the outside air temperature.
[18:42.77]And this may be cool enough to keep foods fresh,
[18:46.10]at least for a short time.
[18:48.47]Some foods can make you sick if they are stored in conditions
[18:52.28]that are not cold enough to prevent the growth of harmful organisms.
[18:57.04]Freezing can keep some foods 
[18:58.59]in good condition for months after the growing season.
[19:03.51]Yet foods can be damaged if they are kept too cold.
[19:07.89]The British development group Practical Action
[19:10.90]says the best way to prepare foods for storage
[19:14.02]is at harvest time while still in the field.
[19:17.58]Use a sharp knife and place the harvested items
[19:20.97]on a clean surface or directly into storage containers.
[19:25.50]Do not put them on the ground.
[19:28.18]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[19:34.69]23. How did people keep foods fresh 
[19:38.72]before refrigerators were invented?
[19:56.79]24. What should be done to keep the cloth wet?
[20:16.41]25. What¡¯s the best way to prepare foods 
[20:20.25]for storage according to the passage?
[20:38.65]Section C
[20:39.64]Directions: In this section,
[20:42.25]you will hear a passage three times.
[20:45.32]When the passage is read for the first time,
[20:48.31]you should listen carefully for its general idea.
[20:52.23]When the passage is read for the second time,
[20:55.60]you are required to fill in the blanks 
[20:57.80]with the exact words you have just heard.
[21:01.37]Finally, when the passage is read for the third time,
[21:05.56]you should check what you have written.
[21:08.79]Now listen to the passage.
[21:11.68]TOEIC is the Test of English for International Communication.
[21:16.50]It measures the ability of people to communicate
[21:19.37]in the workplace using everyday English.
[21:23.01]Each year, the TOEIC is taken in the United States about 20 000 times.
[21:28.78]So how popular does that make it?
[21:31.37]Well, consider that last year,
[21:33.84]the test was given more than five million times worldwide.
[21:37.97]Non-native English speakers take the test 
[21:39.94]to demonstrate their English skills
[21:42.44]when seeking a new job or a promotion.
[21:45.92]Some organizations use the TOEIC to measure progress
[21:50.04]in English training programs and as a placement test.
[21:53.76]The cost of the test is set locally in each country.
[21:57.55]In fact, the TOEIC consists of two tests.
[22:01.00]People can take one or both of them.
[22:03.87]One is a written test that measures listening and reading skills.
[22:08.44]The other test is given on a computer 
[22:10.49]that measures speaking and writing skills.
[22:14.34]Eleven questions on the computer test require speaking.
[22:17.86]For example, the test taker is asked 
[22:21.48]to read out loud or describe a picture.
[22:24.65]Eight other questions require written answers,
[22:27.76]including an opinion essay.
[22:30.35]We visited the ETS Website for more information about the TOEIC.
[22:35.60]But one of the first things we saw was a warning about a ¡°phishing scam.¡±
[22:40.67]A phishing scam is a kind of crime 
[22:42.49]that uses e-mail to trick people into providing financial
[22:46.80]or other personal information.
[22:49.16]In this case,
[22:50.26]the e-mails claim to be from the Educational Testing Service.
[22:54.57]Experts advise people taking the TOEIC to be suspicious of any e-mail
[22:59.41]claiming to be from ETS.
[23:02.21]They should be especially suspicious of messages
[23:05.25]that ask for information that they have already provided for the test.
[23:11.75]Now the passage will be read again.
