[00:04.24]Section A
[00:05.49]Directions: In this section,
[00:08.46]you will hear three news reports. 
[00:11.59]At the end of each news report,
[00:14.01]you will hear two or three questions. 
[00:17.26]Both the news report and the questions will be spoken only once. 
[00:23.50]After you hear a question,
[00:25.53]you must choose the best answer from the four choices 
[00:29.73]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[00:32.46]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[00:36.77]with a single line through the centre.
[00:39.79]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:44.91]The women¡¯s marathon opens the final day of competition,
[00:49.26]but that 42.2-kilometer race,
[00:53.58]which begins and ends at the historic Brandenburg Gate,
[00:57.70]is only the beginning. 
[01:00.46]The women go for the gold in three other events,
[01:03.77]including the long jump,
[01:05.51]four-by-400-meter relay and the 1 500 meters.
[01:10.85]Anna Willard of the United States is one of three Americans 
[01:15.85]to make the 400-meter finals 
[01:18.80]and she told VOA Sports about her plan for Sunday. 
[01:23.57]The men will also be busy Sunday 
[01:26.85]with four gold medal events. 
[01:29.29]They begin with the javelin throw,
[01:31.87]followed by the 1 500 and 800 meters. 
[01:36.43]American Nick Symmonds won his 800-meter semifinal heat,
[01:42.45]despite having three runners in front of him trip and fall down. 
[01:47.74]The last event of the Championships will be the final 
[01:51.61]of the men¡¯s four-by-400-meter relay. 
[01:57.45]1.What¡¯s the topic of this news item? 
[02:19.56]2.How many gold medal events will take place 
[02:21.60]on the last day?
[02:38.26]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:44.44]A massive storm that dumped  about a half-meter of snow 
[02:47.77]from Virginia to Maine did more than frustrate motorists. 
[02:52.02]It added to the woes of retailers 
[02:56.26]that were already bracing for weak holiday sales 
[02:58.82]as the United States struggles to emerge 
[03:01.62]from the deepest and longest recession of the post-World War II era. 
[03:06.47]The storm¡¯s timing could hardly have been worse,
[03:10.49]blanketing the most-populous regions of the United States 
[03:14.23]on the last weekend before Christmas,
[03:17.02]when millions of Americans are preparing to exchange gifts.
[03:21.28]Even before the storm,
[03:23.02]the National Retail Federation was predicting 
[03:26.15]a one percent drop in US holiday sales compared to last year. 
[03:30.66]Although an economic recovery is believed to be underway,
[03:34.70]US unemployment remains stubbornly high 
[03:38.09]and consumers appear more focused 
[03:40.62]on saving and debt reduction than spending.
[03:44.15]3.What could be the result of the snow 
[03:49.94]mentioned in the news item?
[04:07.66]4.When did the snow drop according to the news item?
[04:28.34]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:33.63]US President Barack Obama and other leaders are in Japan 
[04:38.53]for the two-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit. 
[04:43.49]They are meeting in the port city of Yokohama 
[04:47.99]on the heels of the G20 summit in Seoul,
[04:51.76]where trade imbalances and currency strains dominated discussions. 
[04:57.42]Those issues are also expected 
[05:00.26]to top the agenda at the APEC summit.
[05:03.86]In Yokohama,
[05:05.37]Mr.Obama will push for a regional free trade agreement. 
[05:10.00]The Trans-Pacific Partnership would cut import tariffs 
[05:14.59]for nine countries,
[05:16.03]including Australia and Japan.
[05:18.18]Washington hopes such a partnership would lead to 
[05:22.36]the larger goal of free trade among all 21 APEC countries. 
[05:28.09]5.Where will the APEC Summit be held?
[05:50.25]6. What will the APEC Summit focus on?
[06:09.93]7.How many APEC countries are there altogether?
[06:31.34]Section B
[06:32.54]Directions: In this section,
[06:34.46]you will hear two long conversations. 
[06:37.26]At the end of each conversation,
[06:40.02]you will hear four questions. 
[06:42.86]Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once. 
[06:48.22]After you hear a question,
[06:50.69]you must choose the best answer from the four choices 
[06:54.22]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[06:58.14]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[07:02.71]with a single line through the centre.
[07:05.56]Conversation One
[07:07.14]W: Mike, why are so many Americans overweight?
[07:11.93]M: Well, that¡¯s a good question,Lily. 
[07:14.70]You¡¯d think that 
[07:16.62]with the current fitness craze in the US,
[07:18.62]there wouldn¡¯t be so many overweight Americans.
[07:20.87]W: Yes. How many people are overweight?
[07:24.28]M: About 40% of Americans are overweight. 
[07:28.18]What¡¯s interesting is that one study says 
[07:31.28]that lower-income groups have a higher percentage of 
[07:34.00]being overweight than higher-income groups.
[07:37.45]W: Are there any other factors like that in the study?
[07:39.63]M: Yes. The study also says that the hotter the climate is,
[07:44.30]the lower the percentage of fat people is.
[07:47.40]W: That makes sense. 
[07:48.87]When it¡¯s hot,
[07:49.82]you usually don¡¯t feel like eating a lot.
[07:51.97]M: Is that why Japanese people are typically skinnier than Americans?
[07:56.55]W: Well, our food has less fat and oil than American food does. 
[08:01.24]And Americans eat a lot more meat than we do. 
[08:04.94]M: You¡¯re right. 
[08:05.88]And we also eat more sugar and junk food. 
[08:08.66]But there¡¯s another reason why so many Americans are fat.
[08:12.58]W: What¡¯s that?
[08:13.63]M: Nobody works out any more¡ªnot even kids. 
[08:17.12]The average American home has the TV on for six hours a day!
[08:22.08]W: Wow! No wonder you Americans are so fat. 
[08:26.16]You don¡¯t get enough exercise. 
[08:28.27]Say, Mike, aren¡¯t you getting a little bigger in the waist?
[08:32.62]M: Yeah, I guess so.
[08:34.09]W: To lose weight,
[08:35.68]you really need to watch what you eat and get some exercise.
[08:39.60]M: Hey, I started a diet and lost ten pounds.
[08:43.36]W: So what happened afterwards? 
[08:45.82]M: I quit and gained it all back plus five pounds.
[08:49.83] Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation 
[08:54.37]you have just heard.
[08:56.89]8. What does the study say about lower-income groups?
[09:18.25]9. What is the reason the man gives for Americans¡¯ fatness?
[09:39.06]10. What does the woman suggest the man do to lose weight?
[09:59.40]11. What happened to the man finally?
[10:19.08]Conversation Two
[10:20.41]M: Good morning,Amanda£¡
[10:21.54]W: Hi, Mike! Nice day,isn¡¯t it?
[10:24.46]M: Yeah, so why are you up so early? 
[10:27.56]Have you decided to take up jogging in the park like me?
[10:31.50]W: No, Mike. 
[10:33.00]You know I really can¡¯t stand jogging. 
[10:35.85]It¡¯s so boring. 
[10:37.68]I¡¯ve joined a yoga class at our local fitness centre. 
[10:41.38]I hear it¡¯s a great way to stay fit. 
[10:44.05]Want to join me?
[10:45.48]M: No way! Yoga is for girls. 
[10:48.48]I¡¯d rather do some weights at the gym at weekends 
[10:52.38]than put my body into painful postures.
[10:55.03]W: Come on,
[10:56.21]there¡¯s more fun in yoga than that! 
[10:59.39]It¡¯s perfect for both physical and spiritual well-being. 
[11:03.31]It also helps your body become more flexible.
[11:06.31]M: No, thanks. 
[11:07.62]I think all of this is just a money-making game. 
[11:11.50]I¡¯m telling you Amanda,
[11:12.94]don¡¯t buy into it! If you want to keep fit,
[11:16.28]you should take some physical exercises. 
[11:18.82]W: Mike, we just learn three new postures every day 
[11:23.15]and do some meditation. 
[11:24.91]My yoga mentor is going to teach us about breathing today. 
[11:29.02]Do you know that we don¡¯t even breathe properly any more?
[11:32.85]M: Count me out! I don¡¯t need anyone to tell me 
[11:35.80]how to breathe! 
[11:37.30]Just because celebrities are doing yoga,
[11:39.91]everyone¡¯s jumping on the bandwagon.
[11:42.23]W: That¡¯s not true! You¡¯re always reluctant 
[11:45.35]to try something new. 
[11:46.99]Give it a chance,
[11:48.39]you might enjoy it.
[11:49.52]M: OK, but only if you promise 
[11:52.60]I¡¯ll end up with a body like a tough strong man!
[11:55.85]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation 
[12:00.42]you have just heard.
[12:03.03]12. What kind of exercise does the man do in the morning?
[12:24.90]13. Which is a function of yoga?
[12:44.19]14. What will the woman's yoga mentor teach them today? 
[13:06.78]15. Why is yoga popular nowadays according to the man?
[13:26.43]Section C
[13:27.87]Directions: In this section,
[13:30.14]you will hear three passages. 
[13:32.59]At the end of each passage,
[13:34.74]you will hear some questions. 
[13:36.39]Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once. 
[13:41.81]After you hear a question,
[13:43.94]you must choose the best answer from the four choices 
[13:48.02]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[13:51.18]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[13:55.58]with a single line through the centre.
[13:59.83]Passage One
[14:01.47]Costa Rica is at the southern point of Central America,
[14:04.88]borders to the north by Nicaragua and Panama to the south. 
[14:09.49]It¡¯s a little smaller than the state of West Virginia 
[14:12.70]and largely mountainous with thin strips of low lands 
[14:17.45]by the Pacific and Caribbean. 
[14:19.72]Traditionally focused on exporting bananas and coffee,
[14:23.46]Costa Rica¡¯s new top industry is tourism. 
[14:28.52]Many tourists arrive in the capital San Jos¨¦ 
[14:31.55]and head straight for the Pacific coast beaches. 
[14:35.18]But if you are looking for something a little out of the ordinary,
[14:39.52]the country has several prime spots for volcano watching 
[14:44.48]but the most popular is Arenal,
[14:47.25]near the town of La Fortuna. 
[14:49.62]The volcano creates many hot springs. 
[14:52.76]Costa Rica is rich in wild life and ranks 
[14:56.92]as one of the most bio-diverse countries. 
[14:59.94]Its national parks are home to everything 
[15:02.61]from howler monkeys to white-faced capuchins. 
[15:06.05]It¡¯s a bird watchers¡¯ paradise with over 800 species. 
[15:10.73]On the ground,
[15:11.59]tapirs sniff for food using their short trunks 
[15:15.09]to grab leaves and fruit. 
[15:16.75]Along the coast,
[15:18.13]turtle watching is popular,
[15:20.37]especially in April and May. 
[15:23.13]Leatherbacks and green turtles lurch upon to the beach 
[15:27.48]to lay their eggs. 
[15:28.47]They only rest for a little while before 
[15:31.73]making the return trip back out to sea. 
[15:35.09]So it¡¯s natural that when you¡¯re planning a trip,
[15:38.29]the right time to go depends on what you want to do. 
[15:42.13]The dry season for most of the country runs 
[15:45.53]from December to April. 
[15:47.31]The following months are wet seasons. 
[15:49.69]The different parts of the year are best for surfing,
[15:53.38]fishing and animal watching,
[15:55.69]so there is always something happening. 
[15:58.14]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage 
[16:03.34]you have just heard.
[16:05.11]16. What¡¯s the top industry of Costa Rica nowadays?
[16:26.32]17. When can tourists see turtles along the coast?
[16:47.16]18. When is the wet season for most of Costa Rica?
[17:07.25]Passage Two
[17:08.60]A total solar eclipse occurred this year. 
[17:11.67]A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes 
[17:15.32]between the Earth and the Sun,
[17:17.85]thereby totally or partially obscuring 
[17:20.75]the Earth¡¯s view of the Sun. 
[17:22.92]A total solar eclipse occurs 
[17:25.33]when the Moon¡¯s apparent diametre is larger than the Sun,
[17:29.74]blocking all direct sunlight and turning day into darkness. 
[17:34.67]And it occurs in a narrow path across the surface of the Earth,
[17:39.34]while a partial solar eclipse will be visible 
[17:42.68]over a region thousands of miles wide. 
[17:45.45]It had a magnitude of 1.0394 that was visible 
[17:51.73]from a narrow corridor through northern Canada,
[17:54.94]Greenland, central Russia,eastern Kazakhstan,
[17:58.66]and western Mongolia.
[18:01.10]Occurring north of the Arctic Circle,
[18:04.43]it belonged to the so-called midnight sun eclipses. 
[18:07.65]The largest city on the path of the eclipse 
[18:11.09]was Novosibirsk in Russia. 
[18:14.57]The total eclipse lasted for two minutes,
[18:18.35]and covered 0.4% of the Earth¡¯s surface 
[18:22.25]in a 10 200 km long path. 
[18:26.13]It is the 47th eclipse of the 126th Saros cycle,
[18:31.99]which began with a partial eclipse on March 10,
[18:36.21]1179 and will conclude with a partial eclipse 
[18:40.83]on May 3,2459. 
[18:44.60]It was described by observers 
[18:47.20]as ¡°special for its colors around the horizon. 
[18:50.52]There were wonderful oranges and reds all around,
[18:54.34]the clouds lit up,
[18:56.87]some dark in silhouette,some golden,
[18:59.76]glowing yellowy-orange in the distance. 
[19:02.33]You could see the shadow approaching 
[19:05.63]against the clouds and then rushing away as it left.¡±
[19:09.17]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage 
[19:14.47]you have just heard.
[19:16.47]19. When does solar eclipse happen£¿
[19:36.86]20. Where can the eclipse be seen?
[19:56.26]21. How long did this total eclipse last?
[20:16.33]Passage Three
[20:17.85]In the US, medicine, the nation¡¯s most conservative profession,
[20:22.20]is being shaken up. 
[20:24.09]Many medical students and young doctors are determined 
[20:27.08]to change its rules and traditions. 
[20:29.95]Old practices like the one-to-one doctor-patient relationship 
[20:34.20]and the direct fee for service are losing respect. 
[20:37.98]The American Medical Association,
[20:39.90]traditional foe of any system hinting of collectivism,
[20:44.36]is losing membership. 
[20:46.19]Yet resistance to change is strong,
[20:48.89]and no speedy revolution of US medicine is in sight. 
[20:53.57]What is happening amounts to a slow,
[20:57.93]often painful evolution that is shaping a new kind of doctor. 
[21:00.97]Jeffrey Beckwith, 26, 
[21:03.25]an intern at Bronson Methodist Hospital in Kalamazoo,
[21:07.23]Michigan, represents only a vocal minority,
[21:11.28]but his attitudes are significant. 
[21:13.62]He is more like his grandfather than his father,
[21:17.17]preferring the model of the old general practitioner (GP) 
[21:21.73]to that of the specialist or researcher. 
[21:25.65]He recognizes the inadequacies of the old GP,
[21:29.24]but thinks that better training can overcome them. 
[21:33.01]He acknowledges the need for specialists,
[21:35.94]but envisions them as part of a team. 
[21:38.80]¡°Specialists take one organ and ignore everything else,¡± 
[21:42.98]says Jeffrey Beckwith. 
[21:44.38]¡°I want to get it all together.¡± 
[21:46.87]He is less interested in solo practice and a big income. 
[21:51.95]But he is ready to seek partnerships,
[21:54.13]which he values most. 
[21:56.60]He is willing to accept government participation in medicine 
[22:00.15]and new types of health insurance schemes. 
[22:03.01]Though only a radical few favor socialization,
[22:06.54]most see health care as a citizen¡¯s right 
[22:09.29]rather than a privilege. 
[22:10.77]They also realize that the money necessary 
[22:13.53]to assure that right for all 
[22:15.60]and some degree of supervision over its spending 
[22:18.64]will have to come from some level of government.
[22:21.89]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage 
[22:27.41]you have just heard.
[22:29.02]22. What happened to US medicine?
[22:49.13]23. What kind of doctor was Jeffrey¡¯s grandfather?
[23:10.26]24. What does Jeffrey value most?
[23:29.91]25. What is people¡¯s attitude to the health care? 
[23:50.27]This is the end of listening comprehension.
