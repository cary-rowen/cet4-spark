[00:02.42]Model Test Ten
[00:03.92]Section A
[00:07.01]Directions: In this section,
[00:10.53]you will hear three news reports. 
[00:13.77]At the end of each news report,
[00:16.32]you will hear two or three questions. 
[00:19.60]Both the news report and the questions 
[00:22.23]will be spoken only once. 
[00:25.51]After you hear a question,
[00:27.81]you must choose the best answer
[00:29.96] from the four choices 
[00:31.38]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[00:34.84]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:38.72] with a single line through the centre.
[00:43.03]Questions 1 and 2 will be based 
[00:45.40]on the following news item.
[00:49.44]The New Year in South Africa 
[00:51.79]brings thousands of residents to the street
[00:54.33] for a colorful minstrel parade. 
[00:57.81]Brightly-costumed marching choral groups 
[01:00.66]celebrate a unique aspect 
[01:02.82]of South Africa’s multiracial history. 
[01:06.82]Cape Town’s musical New Year’s tradition 
[01:09.91]dates back more than a century,
[01:12.78]to the days when Dutch colonists 
[01:15.15]brought slaves here from Southeast Asia. 
[01:18.45]The slaves served as dockworkers,
[01:20.91]farm laborers and household servants. 
[01:22.18]And, they were given one day off per year. 
[01:29.01]Ethnomusicologist (种族音乐学家) Sylvia Bruinders
[01:32.22] at the University of Cape Town
[01:34.33] says the slaves took to the streets. 
[01:38.19]The slaves copied European 
[01:40.10]and American minstrels who visited the Cape. 
[01:44.47]Eventually, a distinctive South African sound developed.
[01:49.83]Today the minstrels are a holiday tradition 
[01:53.44]among Cape Town’s mixed-race or “colored” residents,
[01:57.64]many of whom are descendants (后代) of slaves. 
[02:01.28]A downtown parade involves 
[02:03.10]thousands of participants. 
[02:05.83]Dozens of minstrel troupes practice 
[02:09.08]throughout the year. 
[02:11.40]1.What is this news report mainly about?
[02:31.30]2.Who brought the Southeast Asia slaves to Cape Town?
[02:51.91]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:58.85]Ben Bernanke is the head of the Federal Reserve,
[03:02.48]the agency which oversees all US banks,
[03:05.89]ensuring the money supply is stable. 
[03:09.43]His term as chairman ends in January. 
[03:12.99]Yesterday, the President 
[03:14.61]announced his pick to take Bernanke’s place. 
[03:18.43]The pick is the current vice chairman,Janet Yellen. 
[03:22.70]She has support,
[03:24.02]but some critics are worried 
[03:25.90]that she’ll follow the same policies as Ben Bernanke. 
[03:29.87]It’s the US Senate’s job to decide 
[03:32.43]whether to confirm the President’s nominee. 
[03:35.19]If the Senate does confirm her,
[03:37.49]this nominee would make history.
[03:40.56]Yellen has degrees from Brown and Yale,
[03:43.72]taught at Harvard,
[03:45.05]and got tenure at Berkeley. 
[03:47.64]Her son is an economist. 
[03:49.78]Her husband has a Nobel Prize in Economic Theory. 
[03:53.53]The 67-year-old has been on the Fed 
[03:56.12]for more than a decade. 
[03:58.40]She’s been a leader for women in her field. 
[04:03.34]3.What is the Federal Reserve in the US responsible for?
[04:25.20]4.What do we know about Yellen?
[04:44.59]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:50.55]The government of Bangladesh 
[04:52.53]has set up an industrial police force 
[04:55.31]for the first time
[04:56.91] to tackle labor unrest in the country. 
[05:00.42]The special force will be deployed
[05:02.39] in four industrial zones of the capital Dhaka 
[05:06.53]and the southern port of Chittagong. 
[05:09.41]Trade unions have strongly criticized the move,
[05:13.06]saying the new force will worsen the relationship 
[05:16.47]between workers and factory owners. 
[05:19.99]They say it will be used against union leaders
[05:23.19] and to suppress legitimate protests. 
[05:26.86]However, the government says 
[05:28.64]the force will be impartial,
[05:31.22]and at the same time will 
[05:33.45]also protect industrial complexes during unrest. 
[05:37.61]The move came months after the country 
[05:40.29]witnessed some of the worst clashes 
[05:42.50]between garment factory workers 
[05:44.34]and security forces earlier this year.
[05:48.90]5.Why does Bangladesh government 
[05:53.74]set up an industrial police force?
[06:11.91]6.Where will the industrial force be placed?
[06:31.64]7.What can we know about the new force?
[06:52.51]Section B
[06:54.24]Directions: In this section, 
[06:57.18]you will hear two long conversations. 
[07:00.51]At the end of each conversation, 
[07:03.08]you will hear four questions. 
[07:06.20]Both the conversation and the questions 
[07:08.41]will be spoken only once. 
[07:11.46]After you hear a question, 
[07:13.39]you must choose the best answer 
[07:15.49]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). 
[07:21.86]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[07:25.69]with a single line through the centre.
[07:28.72]Conversation One
[07:30.45]W:  What are you reading now?
[07:32.41]M: I’m looking at this beauty in the picture. 
[07:35.73]Look! She’s really pretty,isn’t she? 
[07:39.13]Her skin looks so baby smooth!
[07:42.30]W:  Well,it’s just that she puts lots of make-up on her face. 
[07:46.06]Actually, natural beauty comes from within. 
[07:49.41]And you know nowadays the camera work is so artificial. 
[07:53.14]M: Ah, yeah, I can smell jealousy in the air!
[07:57.61]W: Oh, no. She has nothing that deserves my jealousy. 
[08:01.78]I don’t have to put things on my face and I still look pretty. 
[08:05.49]Don’t you think so?
[08:06.83]M: Yeah, right! But what did you put on your face last night,
[08:11.83]those little greenish things?
[08:14.03]W: They’re cucumbers. 
[08:15.38]M: What? I know that cucumber is a kind of
[08:19.10] vegetable rich in vitamin A. 
[08:21.46]How is it used in the skincare?
[08:23.42]W: Well, it is a fashion nowadays 
[08:25.59]that women tend to use the natural vegetables for skincare. 
[08:29.69]And they are much better than any chemical products. 
[08:33.17]M: Really? Then what does the cucumber do for you?
[08:37.07]W: They’re natural skin smoothers,
[08:39.32]natural healers of the skin. 
[08:41.55]Haven’t you heard them say on TV that...er... 
[08:44.86]cucumber goes far beyond mere tightening the skin? 
[08:48.21]In fact, cucumbers have been used 
[08:50.25]as a dry skin remedy for centuries,
[08:53.13]and they are also effective in the treatment of other skin problems. 
[08:57.47]M: I have got a scar on my cheek. 
[09:00.43]Can the cucumber do something about it?
[09:03.42]W: Try some herbal plants,
[09:05.47]which have the function of remedying the scarred skin.
[09:08.40]M: It sounds reasonable. 
[09:10.23]Actually there is much knowledge needed for skincare.
[09:14.21] Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[09:19.81]8. What does the woman feel about the beauty in the picture?
[09:39.60]9. What do women tend to do nowadays to care for their skins?
[09:59.52]10. What is the skincare function of cucumbers
[10:04.38] according to the woman?
[10:20.95]11. What does the woman suggest the man do 
[10:25.16]with the scar on his cheek?
[10:42.34]Conversation Two
[10:44.77]W: What a terrific drawing,Mark! 
[10:47.50]I didn’t know you could paint.
[10:49.29]M: Well. I’m just learning. 
[10:51.83]It’s one piece of work for my oil painting class.
[10:55.56]W: It’s pretty good for a beginner. 
[10:57.78]I think your teacher will definitely give this painting a full mark.
[11:02.41]M: I hope so. But you see,
[11:04.72]last time I had a dispute with my teacher. 
[11:08.32]It seemed that he didn’t appreciate my work at all.
[11:11.92]W: Why?
[11:13.29]M: Look here in the picture. 
[11:15.63]My teacher insisted that it just needed 
[11:18.10]to be  filled in with other colors of paint. 
[11:21.63]But I think the sky should be blue.
[11:24.71]W: Well, it depends. 
[11:26.43]Sometimes it is blue and sometimes it isn’t,
[11:28.50]as sunset can be full reds and purples. 
[11:33.27]M: It sounds reasonable. 
[11:34.71]Then what kind of color should I add to it?
[11:38.15]W: How about light brown color? 
[11:40.71]M: Oh, yeah. Added some light brown to the sky,
[11:43.96] and it will turn out to be more natural than before. 
[11:47.33]You’re so great! You must have taken many painting courses before.
[11:52.98]W: Well, I haven’t accepted any painting training before. 
[11:57.14]But I’d love to visit art museums. 
[11:59.83]Each time I go abroad,
[12:01.87]the art center of the destination country 
[12:04.92]is a quite necessary place for my visiting.
[12:08.12]M: Wow, then what kind of painting do you like most? 
[12:11.91]Oil painting?
[12:13.34]W:  Frankly speaking,I prefer using water colors. 
[12:16.90]I don’t like the smell of the oil paints.
[12:20.27]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[12:26.56]12. What happened between Mark and his painting teacher?
[12:47.27]13. What does the woman suggest the man do about the painting?

[13:49.27]Section C
[13:50.62]Directions: In this section, 
[13:53.77]you will hear three passages. 
[13:56.45]At the end of each passage, 
[13:58.45]you will hear some questions. 
[14:00.83]Both the passage and the questions
[14:02.89]will be spoken only once. 
[14:05.87]After you hear a question, 
[14:07.72]you must choose the best answer 
[14:09.59]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). 
[14:15.39]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[14:19.15]with a single line through the centre.
[14:23.26]Passage One
[14:25.16]West Point is a four-year school in New York State
[14:28.88] that educates future Army officers. 
[14:32.22]The students are called cadets. 
[14:35.06]They do not have to pay for their education. 
[14:38.86]They must agree to serve on active duty in the Army 
[14:42.46]for at least five years after they graduate. 
[14:46.17]A young man or woman must be nominated to the academy,
[14:50.43]usually by a federal or state lawmaker. 
[14:54.29]Nominees also must satisfy the entrance requirements. 
[14:58.49]These include being in excellent physical condition 
[15:01.96]and getting good grades in high school. 
[15:04.53]In addition, students from other countries
[15:07.19] can also attend the academy. 
[15:09.53]The international students
[15:11.22] must be nominated by their home governments. 
[15:14.61]And also they must satisfy physical 
[15:17.09]and educational requirements. 
[15:19.57]Surely they must do well in TOEFL. 
[15:22.93]Home governments may have to pay up to
[15:25.35] sixty thousand dollars a year for each student
[15:28.69] they send to West Point. 
[15:30.61]Among the countries with cadets
[15:32.60] at the academy this year are Afghanistan,
[15:35.50]Bulgaria, Cameroon, Costa Rica,
[15:38.84]Iraq, Kazakhstan, Sri Lanka,
[15:42.23]and Tunisia. 
[15:43.66]Each year, the United States Defense Department
[15:47.06] invites countries to nominate students 
[15:50.56]to West Point and to the Navy and Air Force academies. 
[15:53.42]Not all  countries take part in the program. 
[15:56.84]Up to sixty foreign cadets at any time can attend the academy. 
[16:01.45]And the interested students must seek information 
[16:04.40]about the program at their local American Embassy. 
[16:08.47]The embassy’s Defense Cooperation Office 
[16:11.41]will know how the students can be nominated.
[16:14.76]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[16:20.25]16. What must the cadets do after graduation from West Point?
[16:41.72]17. How could foreign students enter West Point?
[17:01.82]18. Where can the foreign students get the information of the program?
[17:23.29]Passage Two
[17:24.99]Coffee is a part of an international industry. 
[17:29.11]Research shows that as many as one-third of
[17:31.76] the people in the world drink coffee. 
[17:34.92]But not everyone may know the story of coffee
[17:38.15] and how it is produced. 
[17:40.47]One popular story about the discovery of coffee long ago 
[17:44.10]is about Kaldi,a keeper of goats. 
[17:47.79]Kaldi was taking care of his goats in the highlands of Ethiopia 
[17:52.05]where coffee trees had grown for centuries. 
[17:55.17]He noticed that his goats became very excited 
[17:58.04]and active after eating small fruits from a tree. 
[18:02.43]Kaldi reported this discovery to a group of religious workers. 
[18:06.90]When they made a drink out of the fruit,
[18:09.33]the religious workers realized 
[18:11.13]they could stay awake for long hours of prayer. 
[18:14.25]Coffee trees can grow up to nine meters high,
[18:17.63]but they are cut short for production. 
[18:20.54]The plant produces a fruit that is called a coffee cherry. 
[18:24.25]When the coffee cherries are ripe and ready to be picked,
[18:27.63]they are bright,red and firm. 
[18:30.28]Inside the fruits are the green coffee beans. 
[18:33.58]After these beans are roasted at high temperatures,
[18:36.66]they are ready to be made into a drink. 
[18:39.13]There may only be two main kinds of coffee plants. 
[18:42.99]But geography and climate differences 
[18:45.45]have a big effect on the many different ways coffee can taste. 
[18:49.35]For example, coffee grown in Ethiopia is known for its lively,
[18:54.28]sharp taste and its flowery smell. 
[18:58.02]Coffee from the island of Sumatra 
[19:00.32]has a full body with an earthy and intense taste.
[19:04.71]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[19:10.96]19. Who discovered coffee according to the passage?
[19:32.11]20. How is coffee made from the coffee plant
[19:36.10] according to the passage?
[19:53.30]21. Which of the following factors 
[19:57.33]may influence the taste of coffee?
[20:15.15]Passage Three
[20:16.70]We’ve now discussed how most snakes move,
[20:20.16]but there are some exceptions. 
[20:22.90]One is the snake called the American side-winder. 
[20:26.46]From its name,
[20:27.65]you can probably guess that 
[20:29.27]it moves sideways rather than in a straight line. 
[20:32.82]This is because it lives in the desert 
[20:35.55]where the sand slips and slides. 
[20:38.42]With nothing firm to push against,
[20:40.93]the side-winder has to adapt its way 
[20:43.67]of movement to the shifting sand. 
[20:46.20]It pushes against the sand with the entire side of its body,
[20:50.76]and then moves sideways. 
[20:53.33]Think about how a skier climbs a slope on skis. 
[20:57.40]The skier places the skis at an angle of 90 degrees 
[21:01.15]to the direction of movement. 
[21:03.18]The skier then moves each ski 
[21:05.58]by taking a step to the side up the slope. 
[21:08.75]The side-winder snake moves in much the same manner. 
[21:12.64]It lays its body at about 60-degree angle
[21:15.83] to the direction in which it wants to go. 
[21:18.70]By doing this,
[21:20.08]the snake has more sand to push against. 
[21:23.14]Then it points its head in the direction
[21:26.18] it wants to go and leaps to a parallel spot. 
[21:29.71]If you see the tracks left by side-winder in loose sand,
[21:34.44]you’ll see a series of paralleled lines. 
[21:37.94]An advantage gained from this method of moving 
[21:41.22]may be that the snake’s body is kept cooler
[21:44.64] by breaking off contact with the hot sand during its leaps.
[21:50.32]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[21:56.34]22. What is the main topic of the passage?
[22:16.68]23. Why does the side-winder move the way it does?
[22:36.97]24. What do the side-winder’s tracks look like?
[22:56.98]25. What may be a special advantage of the side-winder’s way of moving?
[23:18.63]This is the end of listening comprehension.
