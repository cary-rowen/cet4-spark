[00:02.76]Model Test Eight
[00:04.85]Section A
[00:06.28]Directions: In this section,
[00:09.88]you will hear three news reports. 
[00:13.10]At the end of each news report,
[00:15.57]you will hear two or three questions. 
[00:18.96]Both the news report and the questions will be spoken only once. 
[00:25.09]After you hear a question,
[00:27.26]you must choose the best answer from the four choices 
[00:30.79]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[00:34.24]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[00:37.97]with a single line through the centre.
[00:41.34]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:46.56]The largest fire has burned about 500 square kilometers 
[00:51.58]of the Angeles National Forest,
[00:54.48]north of Los Angeles. 
[00:56.78]Some 3 600 firefighters are attacking 
[01:00.84]the flames in steep terrain,using bulldozers,
[01:04.92]tractors and hand tools. 
[01:07.81]They are also setting backfires 
[01:10.16]to clear away dry brush,
[01:12.65]and using helicopters and airplanes 
[01:15.27]to drop water and fire retardant. 
[01:18.74]They got some help on Tuesday
[01:21.17] from slightly higher humidity
[01:23.49] as they worked to protect homes in hillside communities. 
[01:28.37]Officials say they have carved out 
[01:30.83]nearly 20 kilometers of fire lines
[01:33.80] to slow the advance of the flames. 
[01:37.39]Firefighters are working to protect communication 
[01:41.03]and scientific facilities on Mount Wilson,
[01:44.79]which overlooks downtown Los Angeles. 
[01:48.31]The site is home to transmitters 
[01:50.32]for most of the city¡¯s television stations,
[01:53.29]as well as some radio stations,
[01:55.80]several mobile phone companies 
[01:58.02]and police communication systems.
[02:01.86]1.What is this news report mainly about?
[02:21.90]2.What helped the firefighters as they worked? 
[02:41.71]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:47.07]This week,a political dispute in Washington 
[02:50.41]led to a partial shutdown of the United States government
[02:53.89] for the first time in almost 20 years. 
[02:57.71]Agencies sent home more than 800 000 workers
[03:01.70]¡ªabout one-third of the federal work force. 
[03:05.58]The new budget year began on Tuesday,October 1. 
[03:10.13]But Republicans in Congress blocked 
[03:12.68]even short-term spending for many government operations. 
[03:17.46]They demanded that Democrats change the Affordable Care Act,
[03:21.87]the new health care law often called Obamacare. 
[03:25.66]The Democrats refused. 
[03:28.50]The federal government and states started websites 
[03:31.58]for millions of uninsured Americans 
[03:34.02]to buy health plans or pay a tax penalty. 
[03:38.31]Opponents of Obamacare say it will force people 
[03:41.26]and small businesses to buy 
[03:43.47]insurance policies against their will. 
[03:46.94]At the heart of the dispute is a clash
[03:49.04] between the two major political parties
[03:51.65] over the role of the central government in American life.
[03:56.58]3.What do we know about the Affordable Care Act? 
[04:17.35]4.Why do people object to Obamacare?
[04:37.48]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:42.49]Protests that began last month near Wall Street
[04:45.72] in New York have now spread to other American cities. 
[04:50.94]The Occupy movement differs from the Tea Party movement. 
[04:55.71]Tea Partiers blame big government 
[04:58.27]for the country¡¯s economic problems.
[05:01.48]Occupiers blame big business. 
[05:04.87]One young activist puts it this way. 
[05:08.77]Occupy Wall Street protesters have camped
[05:11.57] in New York¡¯s financial district
[05:13.68] since the middle of September. 
[05:16.40]Police have made hundreds of arrests for blocking traffic. 
[05:21.03]On Wednesday members of labor unions 
[05:24.10]and community groups joined the demonstrations.
[05:28.24]Protesters say the wealthiest 1% of Americans
[05:32.49] control too much of the nation¡¯s wealth. 
[05:35.89]The protesters say they represent the other 99%. 
[05:41.80]5.What does the Occupy movement condemn? 
[06:02.13]6.Why did the police arrest hundreds of protesters? 
[06:23.19]7.What do we know about the Occupy movement?
[06:43.42]Section B
[06:44.97]Directions: In this section, 
[06:48.09]you will hear two long conversations. 
[06:51.37]At the end of each conversation, 
[06:53.85]you will hear four questions. 
[06:56.86]Both the conversation and the questions 
[06:59.20]will be spoken only once. 
[07:02.29]After you hear a question, 
[07:04.43]you must choose the best answer 
[07:06.21]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). 
[07:12.73]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[07:16.54]with a single line through the centre.
[07:19.29]Conversation One
[07:21.70]W: What¡¯s your plan for the interior decoration 
[07:24.27]of the house we are living in?
[07:26.17]M: What should come first? 
[07:28.27]We should list the materials 
[07:30.10]and tools we need to buy first.
[07:32.75]W: As far as the shopping list is concerned,
[07:35.47]I think we can get everything we need
[07:37.47] to fix up the house in one trip. 
[07:39.98]Then it won¡¯t bother us to purchase again. 
[07:42.58]What do you think?
[07:44.10]M: We can try. 
[07:45.44]It seems like everybody had the same thought 
[07:48.31]when they woke up this morning: 
[07:50.35]go to the home improvement store! 
[07:52.49]W: Yeah, it will be a little bit crowded,
[07:55.29]but I still think we can get all we need today.
[07:58.59]M: In order to do that,
[08:00.03]I think we need to split up. 
[08:02.07]Let¡¯s look at our list and divide it up. 
[08:04.51]W: Okay, we need to get some wiring 
[08:06.97]to install the new lights. 
[08:08.77]I¡¯ll go to the electrical department for that.
[08:11.73]M: All right. 
[08:12.59]We need wood for the new fence,
[08:14.39]so I¡¯ll go to the building materials department.
[08:17.94]W: What about the pipes and fixtures we need
[08:19.81] for the bathroom? 
[08:21.39]Can you go to the piping department for those,
[08:23.98]while I go to the hardware department for the tools?
[08:27.08]M: Okay, I can do that,
[08:29.32]but aren¡¯t you feeling tired already? 
[08:31.52]I know I am. 
[08:32.92]Don¡¯t you think we should have a rest after doing those?
[08:35.95]W: Come on. 
[08:36.95]How are we supposed to be weekend fighters 
[08:39.41]if we can¡¯t even do some simple shopping? 
[08:42.40]We¡¯ll meet in the garden department afterwards,Okay?
[08:44.25]M: Whatever you say.
[08:47.24]W: Ready, set, go!
[08:50.27]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[08:55.75]8. What should the two speakers do first? 
[09:15.29]9. What do they hope to do today? 
[09:34.10]10. What do we know about their shopping plan?
[09:53.73]11. What is the man¡¯s attitude
[09:57.11] towards the woman¡¯s arrangement?
[10:14.87]M: Conversation Two
[10:16.90]W: Wow, it¡¯s freezing in here!
[10:19.24] Why is the air conditioner still on? 
[10:21.81]What¡¯s the matter?
[10:23.15]M:  I turned it on just now. 
[10:25.00]I just finished my morning exercising as usual 
[10:28.28]and I¡¯m sweating like a pig. 
[10:30.60]W: That¡¯s no reason to turn the air conditioner 
[10:32.92]on full blast! I¡¯m cold. 
[10:35.98]I¡¯m turning on the heat for a little while. 
[10:38.57]Otherwise, I cannot finish doing the housework
[10:40.93] before going to work.
[10:42.62]M: Are you crazy? 
[10:43.68]It¡¯s 70¨H outside!
[10:46.55]W: I¡¯m no crazier than you are. 
[10:48.80]How come you can turn on the air conditioner 
[10:51.01]and I can¡¯t turn on the heat?
[10:53.48]M: I only turned on the air conditioner
[10:55.36] because it¡¯s so humid outside,
[10:57.43]and it was taking a long time for me to cool down. 
[11:00.75]If you¡¯re cold,
[11:01.77]we should just open the windows and doors,
[11:03.95]and we¡¯ll get some fresh air in here. 
[11:06.26]It¡¯ll heat up again pretty quickly.
[11:08.92]W: What should I do in the meantime? 
[11:11.08]Put on my winter coat or crawl under the covers? 
[11:14.14]M: No need to do that. Calm down. 
[11:16.57]Just go sit outside and wait. 
[11:19.36]I¡¯ll do something to make both of us comfortable. 
[11:22.59]I¡¯ll get myself a glass of iced tea 
[11:25.10]and I¡¯ll get you a cup of hot tea. 
[11:27.58]How does that sound?
[11:28.94]W: That sounds OK. 
[11:30.88]Leave it to you to come up with
[11:32.43] the best idea of the day!
[11:34.18] What about the housework?
[11:35.99]M: Take it easy. 
[11:37.50]We¡¯ll do it together as newly match!
[11:41.55]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[11:47.45]12. Why is the man feeling so hot in the morning?
[12:08.63]13. What¡¯s the weather like today?
[12:27.57]14. What will the man do for the woman?
[12:47.06]15. What¡¯s the probable relationship between the two speakers?
[13:07.20]Section C
[13:08.66]Directions: In this section, 
[13:11.80]you will hear three passages. 
[13:14.50]At the end of each passage, 
[13:16.59]you will hear some questions. 
[13:18.87]Both the passage and the questions
[13:21.01]will be spoken only once. 
[13:23.93]After you hear a question, 
[13:25.74]you must choose the best answer 
[13:27.64]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). 
[13:33.46]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[13:37.30]with a single line through the centre.
[13:40.93]Passage One
[13:42.90]Sixty parents of youth athletes,aged 6 to 13,
[13:47.57]were interviewed in Minneapolis and its suburbs. 
[13:51.10]It was found that parents 
[13:52.63]brought post-game snacks for the team. 
[13:56.12]The snacks typically included such items as candy,
[13:59.99]ice cream,pizza, cheese and chips. 
[14:04.41]It was also quite normal for the parents
[14:06.75] to stop at fast-food restaurants 
[14:09.33]like McDonald¡¯s and Dairy Queen 
[14:11.96]or grab a hot dog and a sugary sports drink 
[14:14.92]at the snack bar during a meet. 
[14:17.58]For growing teenagers,
[14:19.57]a big meal after a tough game 
[14:21.63]or race is necessary to supplement the body. 
[14:25.50]And since they burn a lot of calories,
[14:28.19]they also need a fair amount of fat and protein. 
[14:32.41]An active teenage boy requires 
[14:34.60]about 3 000 calories a day 
[14:37.65]and an active teenage girl about 2 400 calories. 
[14:42.93]Younger children require anywhere 
[14:46.13]from 600 to 1 000 calories a day. 
[14:49.00]Problems can arise,though, 
[14:51.20]when young athletes are taking in calories after games. 
[14:55.14]Very young athletes
[14:56.77] may be particularly prone to excess intake. 
[15:00.46]Actually, they don¡¯t exercise as much,
[15:03.41]and they don¡¯t grow as much,
[15:05.48]they don¡¯t need to be eating every two hours. 
[15:09.12]The calories they take in are much more than
[15:11.56] they burn and do no good to their body. 
[15:15.05]So parents are encouraged to pack healthy meals
[15:18.12] for their children so they can avoid fast food,
[15:22.22]and to leave fruit out and readily available in the kitchen. 
[15:26.75]Schools and sports teams
[15:28.85] should also provide and encourage healthier options,
[15:32.39]including whole grains and nuts 
[15:34.77]and other healthy protein sources,
[15:37.60]like lean meats and seafood.
[15:40.94]Questions 16 to 19 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[15:46.74]16. What do we know about the parents of youth athletes?
[16:08.02]17. What do we know about the calorie intake of children?
[16:29.23]18. What problem may arise
[16:33.06] if young athletes take in too much calories after games?
[16:52.85]19. What is the suggestion given by the speaker about teenagers?
[17:14.33]Passage Two
[17:16.27]About 5 000 years ago,
[17:18.96]the Egyptians and other people in the Near East
[17:22.54] began to use pictures as a kind of writing. 
[17:25.34]They drew simple pictures or signs
[17:27.75] to represent things and ideas,
[17:30.60]and also to represent the sounds of their language. 
[17:34.40]The signs these people used became a kind of alphabet. 
[17:38.54]The Egyptians used to record information
[17:41.32] and to tell stories by putting
[17:43.54] picture writing and pictures together. 
[17:46.53]When an important person died,
[17:48.81]scenes and stories from his life 
[17:51.16]were painted on the walls of the place 
[17:53.03]where he was buried. 
[17:54.82]Some of these pictures 
[17:55.99]are like modern comic strip stories. 
[17:58.66]It has been said that 
[18:00.53]Egypt is the home of the comic strip. 
[18:02.75]But, for the Egyptians,
[18:04.17]pictures still had magic power. 
[18:07.29]So they did not try to make their way of writing simple. 
[18:11.45]The ordinary people could not understand it. 
[18:14.76]By the year 1000 BC,
[18:17.31]people who lived in the area around the Mediterranean Sea
[18:20.98] had developed a simpler system of writing. 
[18:24.60]The signs they used were very easy to write,
[18:27.59]and there were fewer of them than in the Egyptian system. 
[18:31.54]This was because each sign,or letter,
[18:34.24]represented only one sound in their language. 
[18:38.17]The Greeks developed this system 
[18:40.04]and formed the letters of the Greek alphabet. 
[18:43.34]The Romans copied the idea,
[18:45.34]and the Roman alphabet is now used all over the world. 
[18:49.65]These days, we can write down a story,
[18:52.11]or record information,
[18:53.69]without using pictures. 
[18:56.15]But we still need pictures of all kinds: 
[18:58.94]drawing, photographs, signs and diagrams. 
[19:03.56]Pictures help us to understand 
[19:05.42]and remember things more easily,
[19:07.79]and they can make a story much more interesting.
[19:12.43]Questions 20 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[19:18.62]20. What did the Egyptians draw simple pictures for?
[19:39.68]21. What do we know about Egyptians¡¯ way of writing?
[20:00.65]22. Which alphabet is used worldwide?
[20:21.23]Passage Three
[20:23.40]Human beings have used tools for a very long time. 
[20:28.17]In some parts of the world you can still find tools 
[20:31.97]that people used more than two million years ago. 
[20:35.89]They made these tools by hitting one stone against another. 
[20:40.19]In this way,
[20:41.36]they broke off pieces from one of the stones. 
[20:45.14]These chips of stone were usually sharp on one side. 
[20:49.34]People used them for cutting meat 
[20:51.64]and skin from dead animals,
[20:53.86]and also for making other tools out of wood. 
[20:57.44]Tools helped people to get food more easily. 
[21:01.53]Working with tools also helped 
[21:04.49]to develop human intelligence. 
[21:06.59]The human brain grew bigger,
[21:08.89]and human beings began to invent 
[21:11.27]more and more tools and machines. 
[21:14.26]The stone chip was one of the first tools
[21:17.04] that people used. 
[21:18.94]Some scientists say that 
[21:20.47]it is the key to success of mankind. 
[21:24.29]Since 1960,a new kind of tool has appeared. 
[21:29.03]That is, the silicon chip
[21:31.93]¡ªa little chip of silicon crystal. 
[21:34.59]It is smaller than a fingernail,
[21:37.03]but it can store more than
[21:38.69] a million ¡°bits¡± of information. 
[21:41.03]It is an electronic brain. 
[21:43.66]Every year these chips get cleverer,
[21:46.78]but their size gets smaller,
[21:49.17]and their cost gets less. 
[21:51.51]They are used in watches,
[21:53.17]calculators and intelligent machines 
[21:56.04]that we can use in many ways. 
[21:58.60]In the future we will not need to
[22:01.45] work with tools in the old way. 
[22:03.97]Human beings used stone chips 
[22:05.87]for more than two million years,
[22:08.76]but human life changed very little in that time. 
[22:12.98]We have used silicon chips for only a few years,
[22:17.04] but life is changing faster every day.
[22:22.13]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[22:28.96]23. How did early human beings make tools two million years ago?
[22:50.85]24. Why is the stone chip thought to be an important tool?
[23:12.56]25. What is the future like according to the speaker?
[23:33.34]This is the end of listening comprehension.
