[00:02.74]Model Test Nine
[00:04.62]Section A
[00:06.25]Directions: In this section,
[00:09.97]you will hear three news reports. 
[00:13.11]At the end of each news report,
[00:15.79]you will hear two or three questions. 
[00:18.98]Both the news report and the questions 
[00:21.63]will be spoken only once. 
[00:25.21]After you hear a question,
[00:26.96]you must choose the best answer
[00:29.26] from the four choices 
[00:30.81]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[00:34.15]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:38.01] with a single line through the centre.
[00:41.39]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:47.28]Ford Motor reported record third-quarter net income Tuesday,
[00:52.48]far exceeding analysts¡¯ expectations 
[00:55.09]and continuing a surge in momentum for the recovering automaker. 
[01:00.98]Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford posted net income of ¡ç1.7 billion,
[01:07.10]or 43 cents per share,up from ¡ç997 million,
[01:14.19]or 29 cents a share,a year earlier. 
[01:18.21]Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters
[01:21.08] expected Ford to report a 38-cent-a-share profit. 
[01:26.26]Ford¡¯s previous best third-quarter net income 
[01:29.68]was ¡ç1.1 billion reported in 1997.
[01:35.35]The automaker cited a strong product line,
[01:39.25]momentum in North America 
[01:41.10]and continued success at Ford Credit as areas of growth. 
[01:46.97]¡°It¡¯s been the same story all year long. 
[01:50.47]Better pricing in North America,
[01:52.68]and that offsets the small losses in Europe. 
[01:56.19]The North American market is a real earnings driver.¡±
[02:00.58] said David Whiston,
[02:02.43]an automotive analyst at Morningstar. 
[02:07.31]1.What do we know about Ford Motor¡¯s report?
[02:27.63]2.What can be inferred from David Whiston?
[02:47.61]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:53.19]A French engineering firm has built
[02:55.62] what is being hailed as the world¡¯s 
[02:57.75]most environmentally sound building,
[03:00.36]a structure that produces more energy than it consumes. 
[03:05.12]The ten-story building is located in Dijon,
[03:08.97]and it is part of concerted effort 
[03:11.55]to put the city on a sustainable energy path. 
[03:15.51]The Elithis tower is a striking sight
[03:18.40] in the heart of Dijon¡¯s business district. 
[03:21.70]Black, with a red metal skirt
[03:23.88]¡ªwhich actually is a sun shield¡ª
[03:26.20]it is sandwiched between the city¡¯s opera house and a hotel. 
[03:30.50]But the tower is more than just another handsome landmark
[03:34.64]¡ªfrom the ground floor to its solar paneled roof,
[03:37.98]it is an experiment in a greener way of working and living. 
[03:42.72]Francois Pocheron, a senior manager 
[03:45.88]for the Elithis engineering firm that designed the tower,
[03:49.49]takes visitors on a tour of the building. 
[03:52.76]Just about every aspect of its design 
[03:55.33]and construction is aimed at conserving energy 
[03:58.62]and using natural elements like sunlight and rain. 
[04:04.55]3.What is this news report mainly about?
[04:25.42]4.What is the roof of the Elithis tower made of?
[04:46.13] Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:52.09]An unmanned Russian rocket successfully lifted off
[04:55.69] with a cargo of supplies for the crew of 
[04:58.61]the International Space Station on Sunday,
[05:02.13]two months after a similar rocket crashed in Siberia.
[05:06.84]The Progress 45 freighter is slated to
[05:10.47] dock with the station on Wednesday with three tons of food,
[05:15.13]fuel, water and spare parts for the US,
[05:19.28]Russian and Japanese crew of the station. 
[05:23.37]The vessel took off from Russia¡¯s Baikonur Cosmodrome 
[05:26.95]in Kazakhstan at 4:11 p.m.(6:11 a.m. Eastern Time)
[05:33.74]and reached its preliminary orbit in nine minutes,
[05:37.89]the US space agency NASA said.
[05:42.10]5.What is the name of the unmanned Russian rocket? 
[06:02.92]6.When is the freighter supposed to
[06:05.82] reach the International Space Station?
[06:25.87]7.When did the vessel reach its preliminary orbit? 
[06:45.72]Section B
[06:47.65]Directions: In this section, 
[06:50.40]you will hear two long conversations. 
[06:53.76]At the end of each conversation, 
[06:56.16]you will hear four questions. 
[06:59.29]Both the conversation and the questions 
[07:01.65]will be spoken only once. 
[07:04.71]After you hear a question, 
[07:06.64]you must choose the best answer 
[07:08.66]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). 
[07:15.07]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[07:18.86]with a single line through the centre.
[07:21.66] Conversation One
[07:24.22]M: I really can¡¯t stand them anymore!
[07:27.49]W: Who? 
[07:28.55]What happened?
[07:29.68]M: My roommates. 
[07:31.16]Two of them keep talking till midnight
[07:34.17] and make it impossible to get to sleep.
[07:37.39]W: I know how you feel. 
[07:39.41]It¡¯s never easy to live with inconsiderate roommates. 
[07:43.59]I once had a roommate 
[07:44.70]who never cleaned the dormitory or fetched water.
[07:48.40]M: So what did you do with her?
[07:50.46]W: At first I tried to ignore it
[07:52.68] because I didn¡¯t want to cause anything unpleasant. 
[07:55.66]But things didn¡¯t become any better. 
[07:58.46]Suddenly one day I broke out,
[08:00.89]and said something like ¡°My dear fellow,
[08:04.12]I¡¯d really appreciate it 
[08:05.70]if you remember to clean the room once in a while.¡±
[08:08.81]M: Oh, no. You¡¯ve got to be careful with complaints,
[08:12.22]especially when it comes to your roommates. 
[08:15.18]Anyway you meet each other every day.
[08:18.26]W: That¡¯s what I¡¯ve learned from our quarrel 
[08:20.42]and the subsequent coldness between us. 
[08:23.39]Now I realize that I should have put it nicely or casually,
[08:27.18]something like ¡°Hi,Cindy, 
[08:28.95]it¡¯s your turn to clean the dormitory today.¡±
[08:31.66]M: Perfect. It¡¯s hard to take offense at something like this. 
[08:35.48]Maybe we should learn tolerance and understanding.
[08:38.73]W: That¡¯s right. 
[08:39.69]We should bear in mind that we all have shortcomings,
[08:42.20]or rather peculiar habits. 
[08:44.98]When I come to think of Cindy,
[08:46.77]she¡¯s really a nice girl except being forgetful and careless.
[08:51.21]M: I guess you are right. 
[08:53.15]What would you do if you have roommates
[08:55.15] chatting at bedtime every night?
[08:57.85]W: I would talk it over with them,of course. 
[09:00.58]But I would remember I breathe noisily in my sleep
[09:03.90] and often keep them awake half the night as well. 
[09:07.20]M: You do?
[09:07.98]W: No, just an example.
[09:10.92]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[09:16.92]8. What problem is bothering the man?
[09:36.57]9. What lesson does the woman learn
[09:39.08] from her experience with her roommate?
[09:56.92]10. What is the speakers¡¯ common conclusion 
[10:01.26]about dealing with roommate problems? 
[10:19.25]11. What do we know about the woman¡¯s roommate,Cindy?
[10:39.36] Conversation Two
[10:41.50]M: Thanks for coming over,Amy. 
[10:43.77]I¡¯d like to talk to you about a research project
[10:46.53] I thought you might be interested in. 
[10:49.10]A friend of mine is working in Iowa National Park this summer.
[10:53.62]W: A national park!
[10:54.99] I¡¯ve always wanted to spend some time out in Iowa.
[10:58.83]M: You¡¯d better hear what project it is about first. 
[11:02.26]My friend is working with the red fox population. 
[11:06.18]The foxes have been increasing in size lately,
[11:09.33]which is good in theory. 
[11:11.41]W: Yeah, but I thought they were in danger of dying out.
[11:15.29]M: Because of the winter tourists,
[11:17.35]paths are created in the snow. 
[11:19.88]More red foxes are surviving the harsh winters
[11:23.02] because the paths make it easier for the foxes
[11:25.47] to move around and find food. 
[11:28.19]But it turns out that some of them are infected with bacteria. 
[11:32.23]W: Oh yeah,I heard about that. 
[11:34.75]It¡¯s been around for a while.
[11:36.99]M: Yes. And because the red fox population is increasing,
[11:41.43]they¡¯ve been moving more than usual and need more food,
[11:45.36]they begin to hunt in the farm which borders the national park. 
[11:49.26]As a result,
[11:50.43]the bacteria have spread to the neighboring farms.
[11:53.51]W: That¡¯s bad news. 
[11:55.27]Isn¡¯t that a disease that causes animal abortion?
[11:58.72]M: Yes, and it¡¯s caused a lot of controversy. 
[12:01.98]Some of the farmers even want to destroy the red foxes.
[12:06.28]W: That¡¯s awful. 
[12:08.22]Have they made much progress with the research?
[12:11.14]M: So far,they have been collecting tissue samples
[12:14.08]from dead foxes to see if the bacteria are present.
[12:18.51]W: I¡¯d really be interested in working on this. 
[12:21.44]You know I¡¯ve been researching diseased animal population. 
[12:25.67]M: That¡¯s why I thought of you. 
[12:27.98]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[12:33.98]12. What is the man talking about with the woman?
[12:54.22]13. Why is the number of red foxes increasing?
[13:15.22]14. Why do some farmers want to kill red foxes?
[13:36.44]15. Why does the man consider the woman suitable for the project?
[13:57.85]Section C
[13:59.30]Directions: In this section, 
[14:02.61]you will hear three passages. 
[14:05.16]At the end of each passage, 
[14:07.18]you will hear some questions. 
[14:09.60]Both the passage and the questions
[14:11.63]will be spoken only once. 
[14:14.53]After you hear a question, 
[14:16.62]you must choose the best answer 
[14:18.35]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). 
[14:24.05]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[14:27.96]with a single line through the centre.
[14:31.83]Passage One
[14:33.98]GPS stands for the Global Positioning System. 
[14:38.11]It refers to a system of satellites 
[14:40.90]and receivers that allows people and devices
[14:43.92] to detect their precise location on earth. 
[14:48.36]The heart of the system relies on 24 satellites 
[14:52.49]that orbit the earth twice per day. 
[14:55.63]Devices that are equipped with GPS equipment 
[14:59.42]receive transmissions from at least a few of the satellites 
[15:03.61]and are able to collect very precise positioning data. 
[15:08.13]The first GPS satellite was launched in 1974
[15:12.65] and the 24th was launched in 1994. 
[15:17.00]The system is operated by
[15:18.54] the United States Department of Defense 
[15:21.47]and the use of the system is free for anyone. 
[15:25.63]New satellites are periodically launched to replace aging ones. 
[15:30.80]As the technology has improved,
[15:33.13]the cost of GPS devices has greatly declined 
[15:37.40]while the accuracy has increased. 
[15:40.95]Small portable GPS receivers have become very affordable,
[15:45.06]and the accuracy is amazing. 
[15:47.83]Accuracy varies based on various factors,
[15:51.34]but it can be as good as a few meters! 
[15:55.02]Land-based supplementary devices can be used 
[15:58.12]to improve accuracy if higher precision is required. 
[16:02.64]The application of the GPS is very broad,
[16:06.02]and as the prices come down the number of users is increasing. 
[16:11.18]Portable GPS devices are used by fishermen
[16:14.55] to help them sail around the world. 
[16:17.68]Many new cars are being equipped 
[16:19.97]with GPS systems to help drivers find directions. 
[16:24.25]The military uses GPS to guide cruise missiles
[16:28.48] to pre-specified targets. 
[16:31.74]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[16:37.02]16. What does GPS refer to?
[16:57.25]17. What do we know about GPS according to the passage?
[17:18.97]18. Why is the use of GPS increasing?
[17:39.38]Passage Two
[17:41.76]While some people seemed to be blessed 
[17:43.98]with beautiful and expressive handwriting,
[17:47.15]others spend their entire adult lives wondering 
[17:50.36]why their handwriting resembles a child¡¯s clumsy words. 
[17:54.50]Fortunately, there are many methods 
[17:56.54]you can use to improve your handwriting. 
[17:59.60]In today¡¯s computer-driven society,
[18:02.11]opportunities to practice 
[18:03.80]and improve your handwriting are few and far between. 
[18:07.87]However, regular practice is the most important step
[18:11.35] to improve your handwriting. 
[18:13.88]Learning to write is similar to 
[18:16.36]learning how to throw a baseball
[18:17.87]¡ªyou can¡¯t expect perfect results on the first try. 
[18:21.61]To improve your handwriting,
[18:23.75]it is helpful to analyze your words
[18:25.85] to determine what you like 
[18:27.58]and don¡¯t like about your lettering style. 
[18:30.32]Compare your handwriting to the writing of your friends,
[18:33.46]family, and co-workers to see how you measure up. 
[18:37.70]Knowing what areas need improvement
[18:40.18] will make the process to improve your handwriting much easier. 
[18:44.38]Proper technique is often the key to good handwriting. 
[18:48.02]Research has found that many people
[18:50.48] who have poor handwriting form the letters with their fingers. 
[18:54.70]They put the full weight of their hand on the paper,
[18:58.09]use the fingers to form the letters,
[19:00.62]and pick the hand up repeatedly to move it across the paper. 
[19:05.36]This results in a tight,
[19:07.45]narrow lettering style that is difficult for others to make any sense of. 
[19:12.55]To improve your handwriting,
[19:14.38]let your shoulders and forearms do most of the work. 
[19:17.94]Your fingers should only serve as the guides to forming your letters.
[19:22.84]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[19:29.21]19. What is the main idea in this passage?
[19:50.23]20. What is the similarity between learning 
[19:55.02]to write and throwing a baseball?
[20:12.83]21. What is the writing technique mentioned in the passage?
[20:34.88]Passage Three
[20:35.99]Some countries may have one uniform 
[20:38.70]fishing law covering the entire country,
[20:42.17]while in the United States,
[20:44.63]each state determines its own fishing license policies. 
[20:48.91]There are two main types of fishing licenses. 
[20:52.84]Most people are familiar with the recreational fishing license. 
[20:57.65]It is the one needed simply 
[20:59.27]to enjoy a day on the water with a fishing pole. 
[21:03.63]The other type,
[21:04.70]the commercial fishing license,
[21:07.06]is used by those who depend on fishing for their livelihood. 
[21:11.85]As such, this license is primarily used for salt water fishing. 
[21:17.76]Some states may allow those under a certain age 
[21:21.17]and over a certain age to fish without a license. 
[21:25.27]This is seen as a way to introduce young people
[21:28.12] to the sport and give seniors a break. 
[21:32.01]The age restrictions are very commonplace among all states,
[21:37.08]though exact ages may vary from location to location. 
[21:41.41]Other exceptions to the fishing license requirements may also be in place. 
[21:46.56]For example, some states say fishing waters
[21:49.82] located in one¡¯s own county 
[21:52.30]does not require a fishing license. 
[21:55.07]This is to allow those who wish to fish for food to do so
[21:59.12] without the burdensome requirements of buying a license. 
[22:01.23]In the United States,
[22:05.35]those fishing bordering waters,
[22:07.26]or lakes and rivers between two states,
[22:10.36]usually will only need a fishing license in one state or the other. 
[22:15.44]This is a good benefit. 
[22:17.61]It does not matter which shore you are fishing on;
[22:20.12] the license is just as valid.
[22:23.54]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[22:29.76]22. In the United States,
[22:33.77]what kind of people needs a recreational fishing license?
[22:52.77]23. Why do some states allow old people to fish without a license?
[23:14.96]24. What is the aim of not requiring a license
[23:20.16] for people fishing for food?
[23:37.19]25. What is the policy of fishing bordering waters between two states?
[23:59.51]This is the end of listening comprehension.
