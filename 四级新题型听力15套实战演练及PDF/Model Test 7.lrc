[00:03.97]Section A
[00:05.15]Directions: In this section,
[00:08.67]you will hear three news reports. 
[00:11.72]At the end of each news report,
[00:14.27]you will hear two or three questions. 
[00:16.91]Both the news report and the questions will be spoken only once. 
[00:23.17]After you hear a question,
[00:25.21]you must choose the best answer from the four choices 
[00:29.28]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[00:32.18]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[00:36.93]with a single line through the centre.
[00:39.83]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:45.55]The violence this week in Kenya 
[00:47.36]has thrown the usually peaceful country into crisis. 
[00:52.53]Its economic and democratic progress may be in danger. 
[00:57.03]The crisis began Sunday 
[01:00.05]after election officials declared President Mwai Kibaki 
[01:04.80]the winner of a second term. 
[01:06.92]On Friday Kenya¡¯s main opposition party,
[01:10.89]the Orange Democratic Movement,
[01:13.27]called for a new election. 
[01:15.48]Its candidate in the December twenty-seventh election,
[01:19.64]Raila Odinga,
[01:21.56]held the lead in early vote totals. 
[01:24.56]He says the narrow victory for Mister Kibaki 
[01:27.89]was the result of cheating. 
[01:30.04]More than three hundred people have been killed in Nairobi,
[01:34.56]the Rift Valley and Mombasa. 
[01:36.94]The violence has involved fighting 
[01:39.33]between police and protesters and between ethnic groups. 
[01:44.20]1.What might be in danger because of the crisis in Kenya?
[02:06.90]2.How many people were killed in Nairobi in this crisis?
[02:27.95]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:34.32]Canada¡¯s government says it will proceed with plans 
[02:37.27]to send military advisers to Sudan¡¯s Darfur region. 
[02:41.14]That comes despite Sudan saying 
[02:44.32]it does not want Canadian troops to enter the country.
[02:47.36]Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin¡¯s aid package for Darfur 
[02:53.14]includes about 140 million dollars 
[02:56.19]and up to 100 military experts 
[02:59.09]to help the African Union peacekeeping force. 
[03:02.00](But Sudan hasn¡¯t been happy with the move. 
[03:06.18]The government in Khartoum says 
[03:08.74]it doesn¡¯t want non-African troops in Darfur 
[03:11.96]and it complained that it had not been properly consulted by Ottawa. 
[03:15.90]But Martin¡¯s office appears undeterred,
[03:19.98]saying Canada needs only the approval of the African Union 
[03:23.96]for the deployment of troops 
[03:25.79]and it¡¯s up to the AU to get Sudan¡¯s approval. 
[03:30.00]A spokesman for the Prime Minister says that means 
[03:33.87]there was no change of plans. 
[03:36.14]But some critics say Canada should do more. 
[03:39.83]One MP says the plan should include 400 million dollars 
[03:44.19]and 500 soldiers. 
[03:46.31]The 2-year civil war in Darfur has killed 
[03:49.98]more than 300 thousand people and displaced more than 2 million.
[03:55.51]3.What¡¯s the Sudan¡¯s attitude toward Canada¡¯s plan?
[04:17.15]4.What¡¯s the Canadian aid package for Darfur?
[04:36.78]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:43.42]The United Nations climate talks in Doha,
[04:46.31]Qatar, continued into their second week,
[04:49.10]Wednesday,  as delegates from nearly 200 countries struggle 
[04:54.31]to craft a replacement for the Kyoto Protocol,
[04:58.00]the global agreement on climate change that expires 
[05:01.92]at the end of this month. 
[05:04.14]The negotiations are deadlocked over demands 
[05:07.53]by poorer nations for financial help in coping with climate change. 
[05:12.83]Two issues block the way forward. 
[05:15.85]Developing countries are demanding 
[05:18.26]that industrialized nations fulfill their pledges 
[05:22.25]under Kyoto Protocol to reduce 
[05:24.92]their climate-changing industrial emissions of carbon dioxide 
[05:29.08]and other greenhouse gases,
[05:31.11]and to put new,
[05:32.49]larger emission curbs on the table. 
[05:35.09]The developing nations are also insisting 
[05:38.26]that rich nations provide more aid to poorer countries 
[05:42.76]to help them cope with the effects of climate change,
[05:46.18]including rising sea levels and more violent storms.
[05:50.45]5.What is the news item mainly talking about?
[06:12.73]6.What do we know about the Kyoto Protocol?
[06:33.02]7.Which of the following is claimed by developing countries?
[06:53.79]Section B
[06:55.18]Directions: In this section,
[06:57.56]you will hear two long conversations. 
[07:00.38]At the end of each conversation,
[07:02.75]you will hear four questions. 
[07:05.22]Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once. 
[07:11.17]After you hear a question,
[07:13.30]you must choose the best answer from the four choices 
[07:17.94]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[07:21.58]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[07:25.64]with a single line through the centre.
[07:28.30]Conversation One
[07:30.34]W: I¡¯ve just got some good news. 
[07:33.41]Mary has had her baby.
[07:35.55]M: Oh, really? 
[07:37.05]When did she have it? 
[07:38.75]Is it a boy or a girl?
[07:40.57]W: Yesterday. It is a girl.
[07:42.65]M: Our daughter was also born on the tenth of October. 
[07:47.25]I think the two girls can celebrate their birthday together. 
[07:50.59]W: Yes. And she weighed four and a quarter kilos 
[07:54.30]when she was born. 
[07:55.37]She¡¯s quite a big baby.
[07:57.04]M: You know we should go and visit them in hospital. 
[08:00.40]What about tomorrow afternoon at 3:00? 
[08:03.50]W: OK. What should we take? 
[08:05.46]We must take them something special.
[08:07.98]M: I always think flowers are good
[08:11.09]to take to someone in hospital,don¡¯t you? 
[08:12.60]W: Well, people always bring flowers 
[08:15.21]and they don¡¯t last. 
[08:16.32]I think it¡¯s much better to take a pot plant,
[08:19.63]so she can take it home with her. 
[08:22.12]M: Yes, but then she has to remember to water it. 
[08:25.46]What about a big box of chocolates?
[08:28.15]W: That sounds fine. 
[08:29.97]We should also bring something to the baby. 
[08:32.61]What do you think?
[08:34.01]M: What about a baby carrier? 
[08:36.09]Or we could get a little hat,
[08:38.24]or something else. 
[08:39.26]W: We don¡¯t know the size,
[08:41.22]or the right color,do we? 
[08:42.92]I¡¯d prefer a soft toy,
[08:44.74]for example,a Teddy Bear. 
[08:46.73]The girl can play with it for a long time. 
[08:49.74]M: That¡¯s a good idea. 
[08:51.21]It is already 3 o¡¯clock. 
[08:53.87]Let¡¯s go shopping right now. 
[08:55.87]W: All right. Let¡¯s go.

[10:26.62]W: Excuse me,I¡¯ve already done my registration. 
[10:29.70]I want to know what we should do today 
[10:32.22]as far as the orientation program is concerned.
[10:36.01]M: Here is a booklet which tells you today¡¯s activities. 
[10:39.58]On the first page,
[10:41.06]there¡¯s an outline of this morning¡¯s activities. 
[10:44.06]The program starts at 10 o¡¯clock. 
[10:46.85]All the new students will gather in the Main Hall 
[10:50.70]to meet the principal and the rest of the staff.
[10:53.06]W: Could you tell me how to get there?
[10:55.56]M: I¡¯ll show you the way in a minute. 
[10:58.15]Let¡¯s run through this morning¡¯s events first. 
[11:01.03]W: I¡¯ll try to remember.
[11:02.57]M: The principal¡¯s welcome speech will last about 20 minutes 
[11:07.50]and then the director of studies will talk to you 
[11:10.82]about the courses and the different requirements for each. 
[11:13.58]It will help you to select your compulsory and optional courses. 
[11:18.27]That¡¯s very important for freshmen. 
[11:20.47]It will last 40 minutes.
[11:22.73]W: Is that all? 
[11:24.22]Then are we free to walk round the campus?
[11:26.86]M: No! Just hold a second. 
[11:28.66]After that, at 11:30,
[11:31.03]for your convenience on campus,
[11:33.67]the student advisor will tell you 
[11:36.31]about the various services and activities 
[11:38.77]we offer to students. 
[11:40.16]Then it¡¯s free time till 3 o¡¯clock in the afternoon.
[11:43.83]W: What about this afternoon? 
[11:46.10]M: This afternoon,
[11:47.87]you¡¯ll take a placement test on your second language,
[11:50.92]so that we can put you in the right class. 
[11:53.56]It won¡¯t be too hard for you. 
[11:55.73]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation 
[12:00.71]you have just heard.
[12:02.42]12. What are the two speakers talking about?

[13:03.09]15. What will the students do in the afternoon?
[13:22.72]Section C
[13:23.87]Directions: In this section,
[13:26.86]you will hear three passages. 
[13:29.17]At the end of each passage,
[13:31.23]you will hear some questions. 
[13:33.35]Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once. 
[13:38.42]After you hear a question,
[13:40.72]you must choose the best answer from the four choices 
[13:44.19]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[13:47.63]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[13:51.94]with a single line through the centre.
[13:54.37]Passage One
[13:56.22]When John Milton,
[13:58.60]writer of Paradise Lost,
[14:01.19]entered Cambridge University in 1625,
[14:04.70]he was already skilled in Latin 
[14:07.70]after seven years of studying it as his second language at St. 
[14:12.52]Paul¡¯s school, London. 
[14:14.66]Like all English boys who prepared for college in grammar school,
[14:18.34]he had learned not only to read Latin 
[14:20.83]but also to speak and write it fluently and correctly. 
[14:25.03]His pronunciation of Latin was English,
[14:28.02]however, and seemed to have sounded strange to his friends 
[14:31.64]when he later visited Italy. 
[14:35.70]Schoolboys gained their skill in Latin in a bitter way. 
[14:38.26]They memorized rules to make learning by heart easier. 
[14:42.45]They first made a word-for-word translation 
[14:45.40]and then an idiomatic translation into English. 
[14:49.00]As they increased their skill,
[14:52.01]they translated their English back into Latin 
[14:53.79]without referring to the book 
[14:55.50]and then compared their translation with the original. 
[14:58.95]The schoolmaster was always at hand to encourage them. 
[15:03.10]All schoolmasters believed Latin should be beaten in. 
[15:06.97]After several years of study,
[15:09.37]the boys began to write compositions 
[15:12.30]in imitation of the Latin writers they read. 
[15:15.59]And as they began to read Latin poems,
[15:18.62]they began to write poems in Latin. 
[15:20.95]Because Milton was already a poet at ten,
[15:25.07]his poems were much better 
[15:26.91]than those painfully put together by other boys. 
[15:29.98]During the seven years Milton spent at the university,
[15:33.96]he made constant use of his command of Latin. 
[15:37.65]He wrote some excellent Latin poems 
[15:40.59]which he published among his works in 1645.
[15:44.95]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage 
[15:49.47]you have just heard.
[15:50.99]16. What do we learn about Milton?
[16:11.87]17. Why did schoolmasters believe Latin should be beaten in?
[16:32.82]18. Why were Milton¡¯s poems in Latin better than other boys¡¯?
[16:53.88]Passage Two
[16:55.33]According to a new study,
[16:57.22]low-income smokers in New York spend 25 percent 
[17:01.53]of their income on cigarettes. 
[17:03.45]The study led advocates for smokers¡¯ rights 
[17:07.36]to say it proved high taxes were unsatisfactory and ineffective. 
[17:13.09]Using state data,
[17:14.20]the study showed a need to help more poor New Yorkers 
[17:18.34]to quit smoking or never start smoking. 
[17:21.80]New York has the nation¡¯s highest cigarette taxes. 
[17:25.44]In New York,
[17:26.68]a pack of cigarettes can cost ¡ç12. 
[17:29.90]It is far beyond many smokers¡¯ purchasing ability,
[17:33.66]and they have turned to buying cheaper cigarettes online 
[17:37.53]or to using roll-your-own devices. 
[17:40.06]According to the state statistics,
[17:42.72]smokers earning less than ¡ç30 000 a year 
[17:46.07]paid 39 percent of state and city taxes on cigarettes. 
[17:50.44]Other studies showed that lower-income smokers 
[17:55.52]had less success at quitting. 
[17:57.14]When low-income smokers tried to quit,
[17:59.75]they were hindered by being surrounded 
[18:02.19]by many smokers and having less cash to buy stop-smoking aids. 
[18:06.54]Cigarette taxes were punitive. 
[18:09.25]The government put forward the theory 
[18:13.15]that high taxes equalled submission to their measure. 
[18:15.27]However, this theory is only true superficially,
[18:19.10]but false in nature. 
[18:20.64]Many people criticize those in government 
[18:23.84]who oppose smoking and increase related taxes in the meantime. 
[18:28.54]Some people argue that tax increases 
[18:31.61]and other programs are helping more people to quit. 
[18:35.08]For example, New York is promoting 
[18:38.04]a number of antismoking initiatives. 
[18:40.38]The initiatives include targeted media campaigns 
[18:44.18]that are designed to reduce the smoking rate 
[18:47.17]among lower-income groups 
[18:48.95]and that prevent young people from becoming smokers. 
[18:52.42]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage 
[18:58.08]you have just heard.
[18:59.06]19. What do we learn from the new study?
[19:19.86]20. Why was it difficult for low-income smokers to quit smoking?
[19:41.23]21. Why do many people blame those in the government?
[20:01.17]Passage Three
[20:02.28]Stress is a very normal part of life. 
[20:05.81]Most people feel stressed at some time in their lives. 
[20:10.56]It doesn¡¯t come from an event itself,
[20:14.04]that is,from the things 
[20:15.35]that are happening in our lives. 
[20:17.52]It comes from the meaning 
[20:19.49]we give to what has happened. 
[20:21.66]We can experience stress any time 
[20:25.01]we feel we don¡¯t have control. 
[20:27.62]It can¡¯t come from a feeling 
[20:29.67]that we can do anything about a situation. 
[20:32.21]Stress is not just caused 
[20:34.46]by our mental or emotional condition. 
[20:37.05]It is also influenced by how tired we are,
[20:40.29]whether we have a balanced diet 
[20:42.63]with enough vitamins and minerals,
[20:44.55]whether we get enough physical exercise 
[20:46.89]and whether we can relax. 
[20:48.56]If we feel stressed,
[20:50.72]there are several things that we can do. 
[20:53.44]First, we need to learn how to relax 
[20:56.61]and breathe slowly and smoothly. 
[20:58.84]We can also take some time out of our worried,
[21:03.15]busy schedule to notice the small things in life. 
[21:06.49]Smell the air,look at the flowers,
[21:09.46]notice the small designs in the leaves on a tree¡ª
[21:12.69]these activities can do much to quieten us 
[21:16.27]and to give ourselves a small break in a busy schedule. 
[21:19.79]We need to take care of our bodies. 
[21:22.90]Being tired makes it easier for us to get sick 
[21:27.15]and to develop physical problems related to stress. 
[21:30.31]We need to get enough rest,eat well,
[21:33.72]and do some regular exercise. 
[21:35.84]Finally, we need to find 
[21:39.24]what is causing the stress in our lives. 
[21:41.79]Once we have found it,
[21:43.73]we need to begin to change that part of our lives. 
[21:47.38]If we believe that we can control stress,
[21:50.60]we can begin to control our lives.
[21:53.67]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage 
[21:58.76]you have just heard.
[22:00.22]22. What does the speaker want to convey in this passage?
[22:22.43]23. What is stress caused by?
[22:41.35]24. What can we do to lessen stress in life?
[23:01.89]25. What should we do after we find the cause of stress?
[23:22.68]This is the end of listening comprehension.
