[00:03.72]Model Test Six
[00:05.26]Section A
[00:06.39]Directions: In this section,
[00:09.60]you will hear three news reports. 
[00:12.60]At the end of each news report,
[00:15.56]you will hear two or three questions. 
[00:18.40]Both the news report and the questions will be spoken only once. 
[00:24.84]After you hear a question,
[00:26.87]you must choose the best answer from the four choices 
[00:30.81]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[00:33.86]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[00:38.01]with a single line through the centre.
[00:41.08]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:47.03]Bushfires in southeastern Australia have killed 108 people 
[00:52.57]and the authorities are warning that 
[00:54.88]the number of victims could increase 
[00:58.11]as outbreaks continue to burn out of control. 
[01:01.67]Giant walls of flame have destroyed hundreds of homes,
[01:06.66]forests and farmland in the country¡¯s worst ever wildfire disaster.
[01:13.25]Witnesses recount seeing trees explode and the sky raining ash 
[01:18.13]as temperatures reach 47 degrees Celsius. 
[01:22.93]Up to 400 fires raged around the southern city of Melbourne,
[01:28.65]where embers rode on furnace-like winds pushing the front forward,
[01:33.57]devouring hundreds of homes and vast areas of forest and farmland. 
[01:39.47]There are concerns that entire towns may have been lost.
[01:44.39]Charred bodies have been found in cars. 
[01:48.14]It is thought many of the victims 
[01:50.92]had tried to escape the onslaught only to be overcome 
[01:55.94]by its sheer speed and ferocity. 
[01:58.90]1.What do we know about the bushfires?
[02:19.64]2.How many fires are there around Melbourne?
[02:40.02]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:45.53]US President Barack Obama is urging the public 
[02:48.76]to persuade members of Congress to extend a payroll tax cut 
[02:53.82]that saved a typical middle class family about ¡ç1 000 last year. 
[02:58.97]The tax cut is set to expire on December 31. 
[03:03.50]Obama¡¯s message during his weekly address Saturday 
[03:07.86]comes a day after Americans got news of a drop 
[03:11.71]in the unemployment rate 
[03:12.95]and the creation of 120 000 private sector jobs last month. 
[03:18.43]The US leader says extending the payroll tax cut 
[03:22.75]would help build on those positive trends. 
[03:25.61]Obama says Congress should not go home for the holidays 
[03:29.94]until legislators extend the payroll tax. 
[03:33.35]He appealed to the public to get the message over to lawmakers. 
[03:40.06]3.Why is Barack Obama urging to extend a payroll tax cut?
[04:02.13]4.When did Barack Obama announce his urge 
[04:06.99]to extend payroll tax cut?
[04:24.26]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:30.20]This week,
[04:31.13]leaders of the top industrial and developing economies 
[04:35.58]gathered in the eastern United States. 
[04:37.57]They met in Pennsylvania,
[04:40.80]for a summit on the world¡¯s financial future. 
[04:44.23]Leaders of the Group of Twenty have now met three times 
[04:49.76]in less than a year to deal with the worst recession 
[04:53.55]since the nineteen thirties.
[04:55.93]Many of their governments have used spending programs 
[04:59.31]to inject five trillion dollars into their economies. 
[05:03.57]These efforts have had some success. 
[05:07.07]Now, the question is how and when to withdraw that support 
[05:11.75]without harming a recovery,
[05:13.98]and how to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis. 
[05:18.54]The leaders agreed to make the G20 the main group 
[05:23.00]for their international economic cooperation,
[05:26.35]instead of the G8.
[05:30.36]5.What is the news item mainly about?
[05:50.44]6.How much money have the governments 
[05:54.11]injected into their economies?
[06:11.86]7.Which is a problem for those governments 
[06:15.65]which have injected huge money to their economy?
[06:34.30]Section B
[06:35.53]Directions: In this section,
[06:38.25]you will hear two long conversations. 
[06:41.45]At the end of each conversation,
[06:43.61]you will hear four questions. 
[06:46.04]Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once. 
[06:51.81]After you hear a question,
[06:54.11]you must choose the best answer from the four choices 
[06:57.74]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[07:01.59]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[07:06.33]with a single line through the centre.
[07:08.82]Conversation One
[07:10.32]W: What did you do at the office today?
[07:15.36]M: I had a really busy day. 
[07:17.09]I had to work a little overtime. 
[07:19.31]In the morning,
[07:20.51]an important client called to place a large order. 
[07:23.93]I had to check some things with my colleagues 
[07:26.65]before confirming the order.
[07:28.74]W: What kind of things did you need to check?
[07:31.76]M: The most important thing was to check 
[07:33.98]whether we had the goods in stock. 
[07:36.06]If the goods are in stock,
[07:37.97]we can deliver them immediately. 
[07:40.30]I also had to check the price. 
[07:42.35]This customer is very important,
[07:44.93]so he gets special prices.
[07:47.19]W: I see. Did anything else happen?
[07:50.09]M: I received a lot of emails from potential clients 
[07:53.67]that I had to answer. 
[07:54.97]Each time, I had to check files to see 
[07:57.98]what we had agreed at earlier meetings. 
[08:00.24]Each client had different conditions and requirements.
[08:03.95]W: It must be difficult to remember 
[08:06.11]the details for each individual client.
[08:08.94]M: Yes. That¡¯s why I have everything on computer files. 
[08:13.09]I don¡¯t use much paper at our office. 
[08:15.38]After lunch, I had to deal with a complaint from a client.
[08:18.81]W: I hate dealing with complaints. 
[08:21.48]Was it a reasonable complaint?
[08:23.44]M: Yes, it was. 
[08:24.57]I managed to sort out the problem,
[08:27.52]but I was tied up with the matter for over an hour.
[08:30.36]W: You certainly had a busy day.
[08:32.58]M: That¡¯s not all! 
[08:34.06]I also had to finish writing a sales report for my boss. 
[08:37.84]In the end,I finished everything. 
[08:40.57]I wonder what will be waiting for me tomorrow morning.
[08:45.11]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation 
[08:49.30]you have just heard.
[08:51.93]8. What did the client call for in the morning? 
[09:12.81]9. What does the man think 
[09:15.88]is the most important thing to check? 
[09:33.82]10. Why does the man have everything on computer files? 
[09:54.10]11. What was the last thing the man did?
[10:13.28]Conversation Two
[10:14.61]Hi, Melissa! How are you doing?
[10:17.35]W:  I¡¯m so stressed! 
[10:19.54]I don¡¯t know where to go to school 
[10:22.52]and what to major in!
[10:24.48]Don¡¯t worry. 
[10:25.23]You have plenty of time to decide.
[10:27.95]W: Actually, I don¡¯t. 
[10:29.56]If I want to get grants and scholarships 
[10:32.41]to help me pay for tuition,
[10:33.96]then I need to apply by Monday.
[10:36.44]M: Oh, I see. 
[10:37.84]Well, let me see if I can help you. 
[10:40.28]Which subject do you like best?
[10:43.77]W: I guess I¡¯d have to say English. 
[10:46.43]I usually do pretty well in English class.
[10:49.72]M: Which subject do you get your highest grades in?
[10:53.16]W: Actually, that would have to be math.
[10:55.64]M: OK. Well, what kind of job 
[10:58.34]do you want to get when you graduate?
[11:00.39]W: I don¡¯t know. 
[11:01.54]All I know is that I want to make lots of money! 
[11:04.79]In a perfect world,
[11:06.93]I would enjoy my work,
[11:08.17]not have to do much,
[11:11.36]and make lots of money!
[11:12.43]M: OK. Stop dreaming. 
[11:14.35]Since you sound a bit unsure,
[11:17.15]I¡¯d suggest taking math and English classes 
[11:20.08]in your first semester to see 
[11:21.38]which one you enjoy more. 
[11:23.95]You can always change your mind.
[11:25.47]W: That¡¯s a good idea. 
[11:26.77]But what about deciding on where to go to college?
[11:29.74]M: Why don¡¯t we go take a tour 
[11:31.80]to some of the universities around here this weekend?
[11:34.73]W: That sounds like a great idea,
[11:37.31]but to be honest,
[11:38.63]I¡¯ve already decided not to go to school near home. 
[11:42.60]I need to broaden my horizons. 
[11:44.51]That¡¯s what you always say,right?
[11:47.17]M: Yes.
[11:48.74]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation 
[11:52.47]you have just heard.
[11:54.66]12. Why does the woman have to 
[11:58.71]decide her school and major by Monday?
[12:17.73]13. What is the woman¡¯s dream job like?
[12:38.05]14. What does the man suggest the woman do?
[12:57.72]15. Why does the woman want to go to college 
[13:01.65]far away from home?
[13:19.23]Section C
[13:20.27]Directions: In this section,
[13:23.08]you will hear three passages. 
[13:25.51]At the end of each passage,
[13:27.71]you will hear some questions. 
[13:29.78]Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once. 
[13:34.77]After you hear a question,
[13:36.78]you must choose the best answer from the four choices 
[13:40.71]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[13:43.92]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[13:48.61]with a single line through the centre.
[13:51.78]Passage One
[13:52.72]Choosing what to eat seems like a simple decision,
[13:57.39]but various factors have a role. 
[14:00.00]Your environment, mood and amount of time you have 
[14:04.28]all make a difference. 
[14:06.04]These factors are directly affected 
[14:09.00]by the American lifestyle and culture. 
[14:11.77]The fast-paced, busy lives of Americans affect 
[14:15.98]their food decisions in various ways. 
[14:18.58]Americans should blame a ¡°terrible food environment¡± 
[14:22.15]for the over-weight epidemic. 
[14:24.55]Scientists pointed to the wide availability 
[14:27.39]of high-fat and high-sugar foods,
[14:30.66]large serving sizes,
[14:31.96]advertisements for processed foods 
[14:35.63]and lack of physical activity as reasons 
[14:38.25]for Americans¡¯ weight gain. 
[14:40.06]It is said that policy,not self-control,
[14:43.26]should be emphasized if Americans want to lose weight. 
[14:47.50]Americans¡¯ fast-paced lifestyle may be a part 
[14:51.22]to blame for their expanding waistline. 
[14:53.88]Most ¡°convenience foods,¡±
[14:56.16]such as pre-packaged snacks or fast food,
[14:59.42]are nutritionally lacking 
[15:02.59]and filled with too much fat and sugar. 
[15:05.39]These foods lead to increased blood pressure 
[15:08.05]because they are high in salt. 
[15:09.98]Those watching their blood pressure 
[15:12.12]should read food labels and watch for packages labeled low sugar. 
[15:17.69]If you¡¯re watching your health,
[15:20.86]look for high-fiber foods labeled low fat. 
[15:23.38]To eat these foods and still watch your weight,
[15:26.19]clinics recommend reading food labels,
[15:29.07]watching total calorie intake and eating foods high in fiber. 
[15:33.86]The high stress level in many Americans¡¯ lives 
[15:36.92]leaves them turning to rich,comfort foods. 
[15:40.26]Long-term stress leads to love for high-fat,
[15:44.12]high-sugar foods. 
[15:45.36]When under high levels of stress,
[15:48.37]there are other ways to deal with it,
[15:50.65]including exercise,yoga, etc.
[15:53.67]Questions 16 to 19 are based on the passage 
[15:58.64]you have just heard.
[16:02.08]16. What directly affects the food decisions of Americans?
[16:08.67]17. What may cause Americans¡¯ over-weight epidemic 
[16:28.81]according to scientists?
[16:45.71]18. What do clinics suggest people do to keep healthy?
[17:06.18]19. How has stress affected Americans?
[17:26.12]Passage Two
[17:27.15]Women hinder themselves on the job 
[17:29.58]by frequently underrating their standing with bosses and co-workers,
[17:34.61]says a new study to be released 
[17:37.18]in the Academy of Management¡¯s annual meeting. 
[17:39.71]When asked to predict how they were rated by managers,
[17:43.54]direct reports and peers,
[17:45.63]women were significantly poorer 
[17:47.93]at predicting others¡¯ ratings than men. 
[17:50.66]A lack of self-confidence isn¡¯t the problem. 
[17:53.92]The women surveyed thought highly of themselves 
[17:57.37]compared with men in the study. 
[17:59.23]But the females simply believed others regarded them 
[18:03.54]as less competent than they actually did,
[18:05.84]on a wide range of social and emotional skills 
[18:09.38]related to leadership,
[18:11.30]according to the study. 
[18:13.47]The ratings included a wide range of attributes,
[18:16.43]from communication and conflict management 
[18:18.69]to trustworthiness and teamwork.Overall,
[18:21.65]averaging all the ratings,
[18:24.60]the gap between prediction and reality 
[18:26.40]was three times greater for women than for men.
[18:29.65]A few companies,of course,have fair,
[18:32.86]transparent, performance-based compensation systems 
[18:36.06]that eliminate gender inequities.But at most employers,
[18:40.15]expecting to be devalued can pay a heavy price. 
[18:43.46]A woman said she underestimated her standing at work for years 
[18:49.00]and paid a high price in her paycheck. 
[18:51.27]She started at a low-paid entry-level job at her company 
[18:57.93]and advanced quickly up the ladder. 
[18:59.66]But she didn¡¯t ask for a raise for several years,
[19:02.54]only to find out later that she was making 50% less 
[19:06.78]than peers with similar or less experience.
[19:10.28]Questions 20 to 22 are based on the passage 
[19:14.17]you have just heard.
[19:15.81]20. How do women think others rate them on the job?
[19:37.86]21. What does the speaker say about the women surveyed?
[19:58.29]22. What is the possible result for employees 
[20:01.91]expecting to be devalued?
[20:19.70]Passage Three
[20:20.61]It¡¯s no big secret that men don¡¯t share their emotions easily. 
[20:27.01]Numerous research studies and millions of puzzled women 
[20:31.65]can prove that. 
[20:33.06]But is it really so harmful 
[20:35.19]if men want to keep their feelings hidden? 
[20:38.29]And don¡¯t women share too much,
[20:40.83]complaining about their husbands to friends,
[20:44.02]co-workers and sometimes even strangers? 
[20:47.38]The answer to both questions is an absolute yes. 
[20:51.51]Men and women could learn a thing or two from each other about 
[20:57.25]when to talk about problems 
[20:59.40]in their marriages or romantic relationships. 
[21:01.05]It might help men reveal more to others outside the relationship¡ª
[21:06.26]and women to talk about it a bit less. 
[21:08.99]There are deep-rooted reasons why we share the way we do. 
[21:13.54]Men don¡¯t want to appear vulnerable. 
[21:16.22]Why won¡¯t they ask for directions when they¡¯re lost? 
[21:19.79]They are raised to be strong,
[21:21.56]after all,not to appear sad,
[21:24.03]scared or needy. 
[21:25.80]Women, by contrast,
[21:27.50]are taught it¡¯s OK to be emotional. 
[21:30.12]Men also may button their lips 
[21:33.05]to protect their wives or significant others,
[21:35.54]worrying that their friends might be insensitive 
[21:38.84]or think less of their partners. 
[21:40.42]They also may not want to get themselves annoyed 
[21:43.83]because it¡¯s hard for them to calm down. 
[21:46.36]Or, as a male friend of mine puts it:
[21:49.41]¡°Men don¡¯t talk about their feelings with themselves,
[21:53.62]let alone other men. 
[21:55.75]They usually have something to feel guilty about,
[21:58.11]even if it¡¯s just a bad thought,
[22:00.57]so why look too closely?¡±
[22:02.57]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage 
[22:07.34]you have just heard.
[22:08.80]23. What does the speaker say about men?
[22:30.47]24. What may cause the difference between men and women 
[22:35.62]in expressing emotions?
[22:52.83]25. Why do men hide their feelings?
[23:12.24]This is the end of listening comprehension.
