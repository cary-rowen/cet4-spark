[00:02.53]Model Test Two
[00:03.75]Section A
[00:04.99]Directions: In this section,
[00:08.33]you will hear three news reports. 
[00:11.39]At the end of each news report,
[00:14.60]you will hear two or three questions. 
[00:16.68]Both the news report and the questions 
[00:19.85]will be spoken only once. 
[00:22.69]After you hear a question,
[00:25.02]you must choose the best answer from the four choices 
[00:29.11]marked A),B), C) and D). 
[00:31.60]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[00:36.16]with a single line through the centre.
[00:39.33]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:52.03]Health officials in Haiti say nearly 300 people are now known 
[00:51.05]to have died in an ingestion disease outbreak in the country. 
[00:55.71]Although the number of new cases has slowed,
[01:00.87]hundreds more infections were reported on Tuesday. 
[01:03.48]The UN and aid agencies are boosting prevention efforts 
[01:09.12]in and around the capital,Port-au-Prince, 
[01:12.32]with a public information campaign on hygiene.
[01:16.33]Experts say that after a long absence from Haiti,
[01:20.09]ingestion disease could now ¡°settle¡± 
[01:22.89]and become a local disease. 
[01:25.53]The UN said 25 more people had died of the disease on Tuesday,
[01:30.85]bringing the total to 284. 
[01:34.22]A total of 3 612 cases have been reported. 
[01:40.25]Health experts say they expect 
[01:43.13]the outbreak will soon lessen 
[01:45.91]but the disease will eventually join malaria and tuberculosis,
[01:50.29]becoming a local disease in Haiti.
[01:52.90]1.What did the UN and aid agencies do for the disease?
[02:16.83]2.What can be inferred from the health experts?
[02:36.86]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:41.33]International Baccalaureate schools began decades ago 
[02:46.55]as a way to teach the globe-trotting children 
[02:49.21]of the international diplomatic corps. 
[02:52.20]Now, IB schools welcome all kinds of children. 
[02:56.81]The program combines what are considered to be 
[03:00.57]the best teaching techniques,
[03:02.88]a rigorous curriculum stressing writing and analysis,
[03:07.19]and an international perspective. 
[03:09.42]The goal is to develop involved,
[03:12.69]articulate global citizens. 
[03:14.26]Bloomfield Hills is a wealthy suburb of Detroit,Michigan. 
[03:19.13]The school district here has set up an International Baccalaureate program 
[03:24.17]at Lone Pine Elementary. 
[03:27.38]At IB elementary schools,
[03:30.00]subjects like math and reading are not taught separately. 
[03:34.12]Subject areas are integrated,
[03:37.76]so lessons in ¡°Mother Earth¡± class,for example,
[03:41.15]cover vocabulary,literature, history, and ecology. 
[03:45.81]The program also breaks down the proverbial classroom wall. 
[03:51.14]Teachers are required to compare notes and plan classes together. 
[03:55.75]That¡¯s the ¡°best practice¡± that IB schools have adopted 
[04:00.57]because it develops teachers¡¯ skills.
[04:03.46]3.What does this news item mainly deal with? 
[04:24.68]4.What can we know about the IB elementary schools?
[04:46.02]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:51.11]Indonesia¡¯s Mount Merapi has erupted with its biggest explosion 
[04:55.92]in more than a century,
[04:57.77]killing at least 70 people,
[05:01.18]burning down homes and blanketing the region in white ash. 
[05:06.10]Authorities said Friday this latest in a series of eruptions 
[05:10.89]over the last 11 days was the most ferocious yet. 
[05:16.01]750-degree (Celsius) gas flowed down the mountainside 
[05:21.32]in a thunderous roar. 
[05:23.10]The heat was so intense that clothes and blankets 
[05:27.57]were fused to the injured as they fled for safety. 
[05:31.48]The death toll from the eruptions 
[05:33.98]has now risen to about 120 
[05:37.20]and is expected to increase 
[05:39.44]as rescuers pull bodies out of the ash and broken rocks. 
[05:43.94]Volcano experts said the Friday blast was the biggest 
[05:48.38]since the 1870s.With the unpredictability of the volcano,
[05:53.76]authorities widened the danger zone 
[05:57.34]around the mountain to 20 kilometers.
[06:01.11]5.Which of the following is probably the result 
[06:05.33]of the eruption of Mount Merapi?
[06:23.44]6.How many people have been killed by the disaster?
[06:43.60]7.Why did Authorities widen the danger zone?
[07:03.20]Section B
[07:04.80]Directions: In this section,
[07:07.18]you will hear two long conversations. 
[07:10.13]At the end of each conversation,
[07:12.64]you will hear four questions. 
[07:15.08]Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once. 
[07:20.76]After you hear a question,
[07:23.13]you must choose the best answer from the four choices 
[07:27.01]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[07:30.60]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[07:35.44]with a single line through the centre.
[07:38.81]Conversation One
[07:40.45]M: Hi, Mary. 
[07:41.43]Do you want to start writing a lab report 
[07:44.66]after we finish this experiment?
[07:46.56]W: I can¡¯t. 
[07:48.10]In fact, I need to finish early 
[07:50.31]because I¡¯m going to the psychology department to talk to Prof. Smith 
[07:54.37]about a job opening.
[07:56.50]M: You mean a job on campus?
[07:58.74]W: Yeah. And it sounds pretty interesting. 
[08:01.62]It involves helping with her study on learning styles.
[08:05.79]M: Yeah. I know that¡¯s her area of expertise.
[08:10.10]W: Right. 
[08:11.00]Anyway, she¡¯s taking some high school students 
[08:14.20]who aren¡¯t doing very well in their classes 
[08:16.47]and testing them to find out what their learning styles are. 
[08:20.01]Then tutors, people like me,
[08:22.45]will work with her,
[08:24.28]presenting material to the students 
[08:26.51]according to their particular learning styles.
[08:29.03]M: Are you getting paid for this?
[08:30.93]W: I¡¯m sure we¡¯ll get something,
[08:33.29]though probably not much. 
[08:35.03]Anyway, it doesn¡¯t matter to me,
[08:37.31]I just want to get some hands-on experience.
[08:39.83]M: Yeah. And it¡¯ll be nice to help those high school students too.
[08:44.42]W: That¡¯s what I thought when I saw the ad. 
[08:47.84]You could do it too.
[08:49.39]M: Really? Do you have any idea 
[08:51.83]about what the schedule is like?
[08:54.10]W: Late afternoon until evening for tutoring,
[08:57.58]I think. After all, the kids are in regular classes until 3:30.
[09:02.83]M: Actually, that¡¯s perfect for me.
[09:05.39]W: Then come along. 
[09:06.70]We will save the lab report for later. 
[09:09.00]But we¡¯d better make sure 
[09:11.18]we do a good job on our experiment first.
[09:13.43]M: Yeah. 
[09:14.48]First things first.
[09:18.38]W: Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation 
[09:21.77]you have just heard.
[09:23.43]8. What is Prof. Smith's area of expertise? 
[09:44.46]9. What will the tutors do for the high school students?
[10:04.94]10. Why does the woman want to take the job?
[10:24.33]11. What will the speakers probably do next?
[10:44.04]Conversation Two
[10:46.26]W: Dr. White, we recently learned 
[10:48.34]that a large piece of the Larsen Ice Shelf 
[10:51.45]in Western Antarctica melted in early January. 
[10:55.04]Could you please tell us exactly what happened?
[10:57.87]M: I¡¯d be happy to. 
[10:59.60]The piece that melted was over 1 000 square miles in area. 
[11:04.93]More recently and quite alarming to scientists is 
[11:09.69]that a 40-mile crack,
[11:11.90]some 30 feet wide in places has torn through the ice shelf.
[11:16.13]W: I understand that the scientific community is quite concerned. 
[11:20.65]What is the significance of these events?
[11:23.68]M: Well, some scientists believe that 
[11:27.05]this is a clear sign of global warming. 
[11:29.32]Back in 1978,
[11:31.72]some American researchers predicted 
[11:34.41]that Antarctica would show early signs of global warming 
[11:38.17]due to the green house effect.
[11:40.22]W: But couldn¡¯t crumbling ice shelves also be a result 
[11:44.08]of the unusual weather Antarctica itself has experienced lately?
[11:48.12]M: That¡¯s certainly possible,
[11:50.07]but you¡¯ll have to remember that 
[11:51.80]over the past thousands of years,
[11:53.65]ice shelves have been through a lot of weather changes 
[11:57.01]without breaking up.
[11:58.76]W: I think most people know that 
[12:00.81]if the ice cap over Antarctica melts,
[12:03.25]the level of the oceans will rise. 
[12:05.44]What sort of impact will this have?
[12:08.43]M: Well, the ice shelves currently 
[12:11.05]insulate the Antarctic continent from wind,
[12:13.55]which slows down the melting. 
[12:15.53]If the winds cause even a tenth of the continent¡¯s ice to melt,
[12:20.85]the world¡¯s oceans could rise as much as 30 feet.
[12:25.12]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation 
[12:29.36]you have just heard.
[12:31.75]12. What are the speakers mainly discussing?
[12:52.89]13. Why are the melting events of the ice important?
[13:13.73]14. Why doesn¡¯t the man believe 
[13:16.92]weather changes result in ice melting?
[13:35.78]15. What would be the likely result of the melting of the ice cap?
[13:56.29]Section C
[13:57.59]Directions: In this section,
[14:00.47]you will hear three passages. 
[14:02.75]At the end of each passage,
[14:05.23]you will hear some questions. 
[14:06.82]Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once. 
[14:11.84]After you hear a question,
[14:14.32]you must choose the best answer from the four choices 
[14:17.84]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[14:21.35]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[14:25.52]with a single line through the centre.
[14:28.78]Passage One
[14:30.19]It is a great honor for me to introduce today¡¯s guest¡ª
[14:35.12]lecturer Henry Taylor. 
[14:36.53]Dr. Taylor received his B.A. degree in Urban History 
[14:40.72]at Yale University in 1955. 
[14:43.87]Five years later,
[14:45.77]he was awarded a master¡¯s degree in Architectures 
[14:48.87]and a Ph.D.in Urban Design from Cornell University. 
[14:52.67]Upon graduating, he accepted a teaching position 
[14:57.16]in the Department of Architecture and Fine Arts 
[15:00.36]at Illinois University 
[15:02.19]where he was promoted to chairman of the department in 1969. 
[15:09.93]Last year, Dr. Taylor resigned from the university 
[15:11.98]in order to accept a research position 
[15:14.35]with the Department of Housing and Urban Development 
[15:17.81]in Washington as director of planning. 
[15:20.37]In addition to teaching and research,
[15:23.15]Dr. Taylor has devoted much time to designing,
[15:27.22]writing, and lecturing. 
[15:29.29]Some of his most famous buildings are right here in the Chicago area,
[15:34.41]including the Twin Towers office building 
[15:39.35]and the Saint Lawrence Seaway Recreation Center. 
[15:41.45]His many articles on functional architecture 
[15:45.04]and urban planning have appeared in scores of journals 
[15:48.74]over the past 20 years,
[15:50.62]and half a dozen textbooks are to his credit,
[15:54.04]including one of the books that we use for this seminar¡ª
[15:57.89]Trends in Urban Design. 
[16:00.01]Today, Dr. Taylor will speak to us 
[16:03.15]about federal regulations for urban development,
[16:06.51]and frankly,
[16:07.72]I know of no one more qualified to the address. 
[16:10.92]Now, let¡¯s welcome Henry Taylor.
[16:14.52]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage 
[16:18.77]you have just heard.
[16:21.47]16. What subject did Dr. Taylor study for his Ph.D.?
[16:42.77]17. Where did Dr. Taylor resign from 
[16:46.77]in order to accept a research position?
[17:05.61]18. What is today¡¯s topic of Dr. Taylor¡¯s lecture?
[17:25.57]Passage Two
[17:26.64]When cars first started appearing on the street in the world,
[17:31.30]there were only few people who took them seriously,
[17:34.84]because they thought they were toys¡ªplay things for grown men 
[17:40.11]who didn¡¯t have much time to play. 
[17:41.64]No one thought that the automobile 
[17:44.14]would ever become the world¡¯s most popular form 
[17:47.08]of transportation after many years. 
[17:49.66]When Henry Ford started selling his Model T in 1908,
[17:54.57]he changed the situation. 
[17:57.08]Ford believed that a car should be the low-cost transportation 
[18:01.25]that everyone could afford,
[18:03.22]so he decided to make such a car. 
[18:05.80]First he wanted a dependable automobile 
[18:09.86]that wouldn¡¯t break down easily. 
[18:12.50]Then he wanted a simple engine 
[18:15.15]that almost anyone could repair. 
[18:17.36]Ford wanted to sell the car at a low price 
[18:20.68]so that many people who were not very rich could afford one. 
[18:24.96]And because of this,
[18:26.72]he had to make it at a very low cost. 
[18:29.43]Finally, he made only one model in only one color¡ªblack. 
[18:35.25]In 1932, the Duesenberg brothers produced a car 
[18:41.61]that many people thought 
[18:43.11]as the brightest automobile ever made. 
[18:44.86]The very car called Duesenberg was custom-made,
[18:49.22]so each one was different. 
[18:51.69]But it usually weighed about 7 000 pounds 
[18:55.03]and had a very wide wheelbase which was 150 inches. 
[18:59.62]It also had an enormous 400 horsepower engine 
[19:04.21]that could move the car from 0 to 100 miles per hour in 17 seconds.
[19:10.36]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[19:16.79]19. How did people think of cars 
[19:20.60]when they first started appearing on the street?
[19:39.66]20. Why did Henry Ford make only one model in only one color? 
[20:01.59]21. What does the passage mainly talk about?
[20:21.59]Passage Three
[20:23.03]Many of us often complain 
[20:25.09]that we cannot remember things or easily forget things. 
[20:29.56]However, memory, they say,
[20:32.06]is a matter of practice and exercise. 
[20:35.37]If you have the wish and really make a conscious effort 
[20:39.58]to remember things,
[20:40.50]then you can quite easily improve your ability to remember them. 
[20:45.19]But even if you are successful,
[20:47.92]there are times when your memory seems to play tricks on you. 
[20:51.67]It often happens that we remember things 
[20:54.63]that did not really happen. 
[20:56.78]One morning last week,
[20:58.67]for example,
[20:59.46]I got up and found that 
[21:01.57]I had left the front door unlocked all night,
[21:04.41]yet I clearly remembered locking it carefully the night before. 
[21:08.91]What¡¯s more,
[21:10.13]memory ¡°tricks¡± work the other way as well. 
[21:13.26]Once in a while,
[21:14.55]we remember not doing something 
[21:16.75]and then find out that we did it. 
[21:19.59]One day last month,for example,
[21:21.84]I was sitting in a barber shop 
[21:24.13]waiting for my turn to get a haircut,
[21:26.47]and suddenly I realized that 
[21:29.34]I got a haircut two days ago at the barber shop 
[21:32.99]across the street from my office. 
[21:34.74]Frequently, we seem to find something funny 
[21:38.02]and amusing in incidents 
[21:40.31]caused by people¡¯s forgetfulness or absent-mindedness. 
[21:44.34]Stories about absent-mindedness have been told for years,
[21:48.51]and we never get tired of hearing new ones. 
[21:51.79]Unfortunately, however, absent-mindedness is not always funny. 
[21:57.34]There are times when ¡°tricks¡± of our memory 
[21:59.87]can cause us great trouble.
[22:02.43]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage 
[22:07.51]you have just heard.
[22:09.63]22. What should we do if we want to have a good memory?
[22:30.67]23. What can we learn about the speaker?
[22:50.19]24. What can we infer about absent-mindedness from this passage?
[23:11.68]25. What will absent-mindedness cause us sometimes 
[23:16.51]according to the passage?
[23:33.77]This is the end of listening comprehension.
