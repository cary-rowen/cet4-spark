[00:02.86]Model Test Fourteen
[00:06.11]Section A
[00:07.73]Directions: In this section,
[00:11.42]you will hear three news reports. 
[00:14.70]At the end of each news report,
[00:17.14]you will hear two or three questions. 
[00:20.38]Both the news report and the questions 
[00:23.02]will be spoken only once. 
[00:26.32]After you hear a question,
[00:28.42]you must choose the best answer
[00:30.56] from the four choices 
[00:32.18]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[00:35.61]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:39.81] with a single line through the centre.
[00:42.73]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:48.01]As part of a three-year project,
[00:50.79]a group of American high school students 
[00:53.48]and their teachers are spending three weeks 
[00:56.35]each summer in Senegal,
[00:59.13]helping to modernize Keur Sadaro,
[01:02.16]a rural village three hours from Senegal¡¯s capital,Dakar. 
[01:07.38]The 21 teens from two private high schools
[01:10.50] in San Francisco,California. 
[01:13.19]This spring before leaving for Africa,
[01:16.23]they attended Saturday classes
[01:18.66] where they learned about the geography,
[01:21.19]language and culture of Senegal. 
[01:24.58]Each year, 
[01:25.39]the students bring athletic equipment,medicine, tools
[01:29.24] and computers to share with the villagers. 
[01:32.68]In the first year of the project,last summer,
[01:36.19]a dilapidated French colonial house,
[01:39.17]inhabited by ducks and chickens,
[01:41.76]was fixed up as a clinic .
[01:44.04]During this summer¡¯s three-week stay,
[01:47.54]the students worked on the village schoolhouse. 
[01:51.07]They helped put a roof on it,
[01:53.43]install solar panels and lights,lay a floor,
[01:56.93]and build desks. 
[01:59.07]They taught village teachers
[02:00.89] how to operate donated computers.
[02:05.74]1.What¡¯s the topic of this news report?
[02:25.37]2.What¡¯s the students¡¯ work this summer? 
[02:44.98]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:50.64]A passenger jet headed for New York City 
[02:53.47]was forced to land at Halifax,
[02:56.07]Canada this morning.
[02:57.72]The plane¡¯s transponder was broadcasting
[03:00.24] a signal indicating it had been hijacked.
[03:03.91]The Virgin Atlantic flight from London¡¯s Heathrow Airport
[03:06.65] was midway across the Atlantic
[03:09.72] when air traffic control officials 
[03:11.68]in the US started receiving its signal: 
[03:15.28]a signal which carried a special code indicating
[03:18.02] there was a hijacking in progress.
[03:21.66]Canadian fighter jets operating under NORAD,
[03:25.06]the joint Canada-US command,
[03:27.27]were scrambled to intercept the jet.According to NORAD,
[03:31.86]the pilots of the passenger jet repeatedly radioed in
[03:34.34] to tell controllers they were not being hijacked. 
[03:38.59]But US officials erred on the side of caution. 
[03:42.37]After the plane landed,
[03:43.94]armed police boarded it 
[03:45.49]to ensure there were no hijackers.
[03:48.50]It was determined that
[03:49.51]the plane¡¯s transponder had mal-functioned,
[03:52.15]and was mistakenly transmitting code ¡°7500¡± for hijacking.
[03:59.90]3.Why was the passenger jet forced to land at Halifax,Canada?
[04:21.07]4.What has really happened to the passenger jet? 
[04:41.28]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:47.44]The authorities in the Australian state of New South Wales
[04:51.91] have urged people living in the Blue Mountains
[04:54.92] to leave their homes as strengthening winds 
[04:58.09]and high temperatures threatened to spread major bush fires. 
[05:03.69]Forecasters warned that Wednesday
[05:05.96] could be the worst day
[05:08.12] since the crisis began more than a week ago. 
[05:11.58]Exhausted firefighters have been preparing for
[05:14.84] their most challenging day yet; 
[05:17.60]they have been carrying out 
[05:19.52]controlled burning of key areas. 
[05:22.54]The ideal was to deprive fires of fuel
[05:25.78] and prevent them travelling. 
[05:28.77]On Monday, they joined up two large fires
[05:32.24] to make one that is easier to manage. 
[05:35.33]Around 60 fires are burning in New South Wales,
[05:39.67]but about 17 of them are still uncontrolled. 
[05:44.53]Almost 120 000 hectares have been ruined 
[05:48.25]by the fires so far and more than 2 000 firefighters
[05:54.04] have been trying to get them under control.
[05:58.08]5.What makes the major bush fire spread?
[06:18.27]6.When did the crisis begin? 
[06:37.91]7.What do we know about the fires in New South Wales?
[06:59.18]Section B
[07:00.80]Directions: In this section, 
[07:03.82]you will hear two long conversations. 
[07:07.05]At the end of each conversation, 
[07:09.51]you will hear four questions. 
[07:12.62]Both the conversation and the questions 
[07:14.93]will be spoken only once. 
[07:18.03]After you hear a question, 
[07:19.93]you must choose the best answer 
[07:22.03]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). 
[07:28.43]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[07:32.33]with a single line through the centre.
[07:35.15]Conversation One
[07:37.19]M: Mrs. Dawson, thanks very much 
[07:39.78]for coming down to the station. 
[07:42.08]I just like to go over some of the things
[07:44.72] that you told police officer Parmer at the bank.
[07:48.18]W: All right.
[07:49.37]M: Well, could you describe the man
[07:51.99] who robbed the bank for this report 
[07:54.37]that we¡¯re filling out here? 
[07:56.19]Now, anything at all that you can remember
[07:59.00] would be extremely helpful to us.
[08:02.66]W: Well, just, I can only remember basically what I said before.
[08:07.58]M: That¡¯s all right.
[08:09.07]W: The man was tall,
[08:10.56]er, six foot,and he had dark hair,
[08:14.16]and he had a moustache.
[08:16.13]M: Very good. 
[08:17.25]All right, did he have any other distinguishing marks?
[08:21.82]W: Um, no, none that I can remember.
[08:25.66]M: Do you remember how old he was by any chance?
[08:29.38]W: Er, well, I guess around 30,
[08:32.59]maybe younger,give or take a few years.
[08:35.38]M: Uh, all right. 
[08:37.23]Do you remember anything about what he was wearing?
[08:40.80]W: Yes, yes, he had on a dark sweater,a...a solid color.
[08:46.34]M: OK. Um, anything else that strikes you at the moment?
[08:50.82]W: I remember he was wearing a light shirt 
[08:53.32]under the sweater. Yes, yes.
[08:56.34]M: All right. 
[08:57.42]Mrs. Dawson, I really appreciate 
[09:00.42]what you¡¯ve been through today. 
[09:02.59]I¡¯m just going to ask you to look at some photographs 
[09:05.64]before you leave if you don¡¯t mind. 
[09:08.59]It won¡¯t take very long. 
[09:10.24]Can you do that for me?
[09:11.70]W: Oh, of course.
[09:13.36]M: Would you like to step this way with me,please?
[09:16.66]W: OK, sure.
[09:18.33]M: Thank you.
[09:19.69]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[09:25.23]8. What do we learn about the woman?
[09:44.18]9. What did the suspect look like?
[10:02.62]10. What did the man finally ask the woman to do?
[10:22.54]11.Where does this conversation probably happen?
[10:43.11]Conversation Two
[10:45.00]W: Good morning. 
[10:46.48]I¡¯m calling about the job that was in the paper last night.
[10:49.52]M: Well, could you tell me your name?
[10:52.46]W: Candider Forsett.
[10:54.31]M: Oh, yes. 
[10:55.55]What exactly is it that interests you about the job?
[10:59.44]W: Well, I thought it was just right for me.
[11:02.54]M: Really? 
[11:03.43]Hmm...Could you tell me a little about yourself?
[11:07.19]W: Yes. I¡¯m 23. I¡¯ve been working abroad.
[11:09.37]M: Where exactly have you been working?
[11:14.04]W: In Geneva.
[11:15.44]M: Oh, Geneva. And what were you doing there?
[11:18.86]W: Secretarial work. Previous to that,
[11:21.57]I was at university.
[11:23.25]M: Which university was that?
[11:25.41]W: The University of Manchester. 
[11:27.63]I¡¯ve got a degree in English.
[11:29.94]M: You said you¡¯ve been working in Geneva. 
[11:32.37]Do you have any special reason
[11:33.95] for wanting to come back?
[11:35.88]W: I thought it would be nice to be near to the family.
[11:38.93]M: I see,and how do you see yourself developing in this job?
[11:43.49]W: Well, I¡¯m ambitious. 
[11:45.60]I do hope that my career as a secretary 
[11:48.08]will lead me eventually into management.
[11:50.72]M: I see. You have foreign languages?
[11:53.71]W: French and Italian.
[11:55.51]M: Well, I think the best thing for you to do now
[11:58.24] is to reply in writing to the advertisement.
[12:02.30]W: Can¡¯t I arrange for an interview now?
[12:04.93]M: Well, I¡¯m afraid we must wait 
[12:07.25]until all the applications are in,in writing,
[12:10.74]and we¡¯ll then decide on the short list. 
[12:13.55]If you are on the short list,
[12:15.05]of course we should see you.
[12:16.95]W: Oh, I see.
[12:18.66]M: I¡¯ll look forward to receiving your application 
[12:21.23]in writing in a day or two.
[12:23.68]W: Oh, yes, yes, certainly.
[12:26.09]M: OK. Thank you very much. Goodbye.
[12:28.86]W: Thank you. Goodbye.
[12:31.78]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[12:38.14]12. How did the woman get to know about the job vacancy?
[12:59.08]13. Why did the woman find the job appealing?
[13:19.31]14. What had the woman been doing in Geneva?
[13:40.14]15. What was the woman asked to do in the end?
[13:59.86]Section C
[14:01.26]Directions: In this section, 
[14:04.30]you will hear three passages. 
[14:07.03]At the end of each passage, 
[14:09.30]you will hear some questions. 
[14:11.58]Both the passage and the questions
[14:13.59]will be spoken only once. 
[14:16.46]After you hear a question, 
[14:18.48]you must choose the best answer 
[14:20.39]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). 
[14:26.02]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[14:29.86]with a single line through the centre.
[14:33.03]Passage One
[14:34.99]One of the greatest heartbreaks for firefighters occurs
[14:38.75] when they fail to rescue a child 
[14:41.56]from a burning building because the child,
[14:44.29]frightened by smoke and noise,
[14:47.08]hides under a bed or in a closet and is later found dead. 
[14:51.86]Saddest of all is when children
[14:54.10] catch a glimpse of the masked firefighter 
[14:56.89]but hide because they think they have seen a monster. 
[15:01.11]To prevent such tragedies,
[15:03.12]firefighter Eric Velez gives
[15:05.73] talks to children in his community,
[15:08.40]explaining that they should never hide during a fire. 
[15:12.71]He displays firefighters¡¯ equipment,
[15:15.25]including the oxygen mask,
[15:17.41]which he encourages his listeners to play with and put on. 
[15:21.77]¡°If you see us,¡± Velez tells them,
[15:25.02]¡°don¡¯t hide! We are not monsters. 
[15:28.32]We have come to rescue you.¡± 
[15:30.30]Velez gives his presentations in English and Spanish. 
[15:35.06]Growing up in San Francisco,
[15:37.78]he learnt Spanish from his immigrant parents. 
[15:41.18]Velez and other firefighters throughout North America,
[15:44.85]who give similar presentations,
[15:47.39]will never know how many lives 
[15:49.34]they save through their talks. 
[15:51.90]But it¡¯s a fact that informative speaking saves lives. 
[15:56.33]For example, several months 
[15:58.51]after listening to an informative speech,
[16:01.59]Pete Gentry in North Carolina rescued his brother
[16:05.37] who was choking on food,
[16:07.29]by using the method taught 
[16:09.34]by student speaker,Julie Perris. 
[16:11.90]In addition to saving lives,
[16:14.40]informative speakers help people learn new skills,
[16:18.28]solve problems and acquire fascinating facts 
[16:21.68]about the exciting world in which they live.
[16:25.52]Questions 16 to 19 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[16:30.96]16. Why do some children trapped
[16:34.94] in a burning building hide from masked firefighters?
[16:54.17]17. What does the passage tell us about firefighter Eric Velez?
[17:15.31]18. What do we learn about Pete Gentry?
[17:34.89]19. What message is the speaker trying to convey?
[17:54.87]Passage Two
[17:56.79]Some people want to make and save a lot of money 
[18:00.34]in order to retire early. 
[18:03.09]I see people pursuing higher paying
[18:05.52] and increasingly demanding careers to accomplish this goal. 
[18:09.90]They make many personal sacrifices
[18:12.07] in exchange for income today. 
[18:14.95]The problem is that tomorrow might not come. 
[18:18.26]Even if it all goes according to plan,
[18:20.93]will you know how to be happy 
[18:22.95]when you are not working 
[18:24.37]if you spend your entire life making money? 
[18:27.63]More importantly, who will be around for you
[18:30.36] to share your leisure time with? 
[18:32.63]At the other extreme are people who live only for today. 
[18:36.59]Why bother saving
[18:37.69] when I might not be here tomorrow,they argue. 
[18:41.10]The danger of this approach 
[18:42.72]is that tomorrow may come after all. 
[18:45.62]And most people don¡¯t want to
[18:47.55] spend all their tomorrows working for a living. 
[18:51.27]The earlier neglect of saving,
[18:53.06]however, makes it difficult not to work when you are older. 
[18:57.44]You may be surprised to hear me say that 
[19:00.02]if you must pick an extreme,
[19:02.09]I think it¡¯s better to pick the spend-all approach. 
[19:05.69]As long as you don¡¯t mind continuing to work,
[19:08.46]assuming your health allows,
[19:10.20]you should be OK. 
[19:12.40]At least, you are making use of your money,
[19:15.01]and hopefully deriving value and pleasure from it. 
[19:18.62]Postponing doing what you love 
[19:20.57]and being with people you love 
[19:22.28]until retirement can be a mistake. 
[19:25.00]It may never come. 
[19:27.02]Retirement can be a great time for some people. 
[19:30.26]For others, it is a time of boredom,
[19:32.67]loneliness and poor health.
[19:35.54]Questions 20 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[19:41.46]20. Why do some people pursue higher paying 
[19:47.16]but demanding careers?
[20:03.62]21. What is the danger facing people who live only for today?
[20:25.34]22. What does the speaker seem to advocate?
[20:45.87]Passage Three
[20:47.38]Imagine that someone in your neighborhood broke the law,
[20:51.48]and the judge put the whole neighborhood under suspicion. 
[20:55.49]How fair would that be? 
[20:57.81]Well, it happens every day to high schoolers. 
[21:01.77]Just because some students have stolen things in shops,
[21:06.23]all of us are treated like thieves. 
[21:09.03]Even though I¡¯d never steal,
[21:11.24]store employees looked at me
[21:13.03] like I¡¯m some kind of hardened criminal. 
[21:15.87]For example, during one lunch period,
[21:18.64]my friend Denny and I went to the Grab 
[21:21.34]and Go Restaurant to have a hotdog. 
[21:23.93]We arrived to find a line of students waiting outside. 
[21:28.09]A new sign in the window told the story
[21:31.12]¡ª¡°No more than two students at a time.¡±
[21:34.46] After 15 minutes,we finally got in. 
[21:38.01]But the store manager laid the evil eye on us. 
[21:41.16]I asked him about the new sign,and he said,
[21:44.27]¡°You kids are stealing too much stuff.¡± You kids? 
[21:48.50]Too much stuff? 
[21:50.15]We were not only assumed to be thieves,
[21:53.10]but brilliant,greedy thieves. 
[21:55.58]The most annoying thing,though,
[21:57.55] is the way employees watched my friends and me. 
[22:00.42]It¡¯s horrible. Once, at a drug store,
[22:03.50]I was looking around 
[22:05.06]and found a guy standing on a large box,
[22:07.69]stocking the shelves. 
[22:09.45]He was watching my hands,
[22:11.42]more than he was watching his own. 
[22:13.56]I showed him that my hands were empty. 
[22:16.02]He got down off his box and rushed off,
[22:18.49]as if he was going to get the store manager. 
[22:21.18]How crazy is that!
[22:23.76]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[22:30.26]23. What does the speaker find to be unfair?
[22:50.46]24. What measure did the Grab and Go Restaurant take to stop stealing?
[23:12.07]25. What happened in a drug store that greatly annoyed the speaker?
[23:33.45]This is the end of listening comprehension.
