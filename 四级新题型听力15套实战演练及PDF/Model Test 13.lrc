[00:02.40]Model Test Thirteen
[00:04.20]Section A
[00:05.64]Directions: In this section,
[00:09.33]you will hear three news reports. 
[00:12.78]At the end of each news report,
[00:14.94]you will hear two or three questions. 
[00:18.35]Both the news report and the questions 
[00:20.84]will be spoken only once. 
[00:24.30]After you hear a question,
[00:26.40]you must choose the best answer
[00:28.65] from the four choices 
[00:30.01]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[00:33.46]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:37.43] with a single line through the centre.
[00:40.16]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:45.90]It¡¯s the first Tuesday following the first Monday in November. 
[00:50.56]In the US that means it¡¯s Election Day. 
[00:54.51]Governors¡¯ races, the New York mayoral election,
[00:58.49]different state referenda
[01:00.78]¡ªthat¡¯s when people vote on issues
[01:03.09] rather than individual offices. 
[01:05.88]Some of today¡¯s elections are getting national attention.
[01:10.69]We¡¯re going to start in New Jersey
[01:13.15] where voters are casting their ballot for governor. 
[01:17.16]According to the most recent polls,current governor,
[01:19.65]Chris Christie is expected to be reelected. 
[01:24.54]There is a governor¡¯s race in Virginia,too. 
[01:27.85]The state doesn¡¯t allow governors
[01:29.57] to serve consecutive terms,
[01:32.20]so the new governor will 
[01:33.94]either be Republican Ken Cuccinelli on the left
[01:38.07] or Democrat Terry McAuliffe. 
[01:41.06]There is an interesting referendum
[01:42.92] on the ballot in Colorado
[01:45.51]¡ª11 counties are voting on whether to withdraw,
[01:48.93]break off from the state. 
[01:52.39]1.When is the Election Day in the US?
[02:12.69]2.Who is expected to be elected governor in New Jersey 
[02:18.25]according to the most recent polls?
[02:35.78]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:41.73]Consumer spending accounts for more than
[02:44.07] two thirds of US economic activity,
[02:47.31]making it one of the most closely
[02:49.08] watched economic indicators. 
[02:52.03]The Commerce Department reports that 
[02:53.94]Americans boosted spending 0.4 percent in June
[02:58.88]¡ªslightly more than what economists had expected. 
[03:02.44]It was the second consecutive
[03:04.42] monthly rise in consumer spending,
[03:06.90]and it was accompanied by a lower savings rate.
[03:10.65]Americans spent more despite lower incomes. 
[03:14.50]Personal income fell 1.3 percent
[03:17.79]¡ªthe largest monthly drop in four years. 
[03:20.97]The decline reversed a 1.3 percent increase
[03:24.29] in personal incomes in May
[03:26.40] that economists attributed to special payments 
[03:29.49]the government made to try to revive the economy. 
[03:33.26]But PNC Financial Services Group economist,
[03:36.59]Robert Dye says there might be better times ahead.
[03:41.79]3.What¡¯s the main idea of this news report?
[04:01.96]4.What¡¯s the reason for the increase
[04:05.91] in personal incomes in May?
[04:23.87]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:29.19]President Barack Obama says Friday¡¯s mixed news 
[04:32.75]on US unemployment
[04:34.78] is cause for hope but not celebration. 
[04:38.48]The President is asking lawmakers 
[04:40.82]to support programs he says will help boost hiring. 
[04:45.53]The nation¡¯s jobless rate eased 
[04:47.59]by three-tenths of a percent in January,
[04:50.61]to 9.7 percent,
[04:53.08]its lowest level in five months. 
[04:56.07]However, the Labor Department says 
[04:58.25]20 000 more jobs were lost last month. 
[05:02.66]President Obama says
[05:04.18] that is a small step in the right direction. 
[05:07.91]¡°These numbers, while positive,
[05:10.54]are cause for hope but not celebration,
[05:14.28]because far too many of our neighbors
[05:17.16] and friends and family 
[05:18.30]are still out of work,¡± he said.
[05:22.23]5.Who are asked to support Barack Obama¡¯s programs?
[05:43.96]6.What is the American¡¯s jobless rate in January eased to?
[06:05.18]7.What does President Obama 
[06:09.72]think of the news on US unemployment? 
[06:28.80]Section B
[06:30.14]Directions: In this section, 
[06:33.41]you will hear two long conversations. 
[06:36.42]At the end of each conversation, 
[06:39.04]you will hear four questions. 
[06:42.02]Both the conversation and the questions 
[06:44.26]will be spoken only once. 
[06:47.25]After you hear a question, 
[06:49.43]you must choose the best answer 
[06:51.39]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). 
[06:57.81]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[07:01.61]with a single line through the centre.
[07:04.39]Conversation One
[07:06.54]M: Hello, Prof. Johnson.
[07:08.74]W: Hello, Tony. So what shall we work on today?
[07:12.67]M: Well, the problem is that
[07:15.02] this writing assignment isn¡¯t coming out right. 
[07:18.44]What I thought I was writing on was to talk about
[07:21.40] what a particular sport means to me when I participate in.
[07:25.75]W: What sport did you choose?
[07:27.87]M: I decided to write about cross-country skiing.
[07:31.80]W: What are you going to say about skiing?
[07:34.48]M: That¡¯s the problem. 
[07:35.77]I thought I would write about 
[07:37.90]how peaceful it is to be out in the country.
[07:40.63]W: So why is that a problem?
[07:42.76]M: As I start describing how quiet 
[07:44.82]it is to be out in the woods,
[07:47.19]I keep mentioning how much effort
[07:48.99] it takes to keep going. 
[07:51.05]Cross-country skiing isn¡¯t as easy as some people think. 
[07:55.53]It takes a lot of energy,
[07:57.32]but that¡¯s not part of my paper. 
[07:59.59]So I guess I should leave it out. 
[08:01.99]But now I don¡¯t know how to explain that
[08:04.31] feeling of peacefulness without explaining
[08:07.00] how hard you have to work for it. 
[08:09.91]It all fits together. 
[08:11.38]It¡¯s not like just sitting down somewhere
[08:13.96] and watching the clouds roll by. 
[08:15.90]That¡¯s different.
[08:17.37]W: Then you¡¯ll have to include that in your point. 
[08:20.66]The peacefulness of cross-country skiing
[08:23.18] is the kind you earn by effort. 
[08:25.73]Why leave that out? 
[08:27.53]Part of your point you knew beforehand
[08:30.13] but part you discovered as you wrote. 
[08:32.72]That¡¯s common, right?
[08:34.50]M: Yeah, I guess so.
[08:37.36]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[08:42.81]8. What is the topic of the man¡¯s writing assignment?
[09:02.77]9. What problem does the man have while working on his paper?
[09:23.51]10. What does the woman say is common in writing papers?
[09:44.04]11.What does cross-country skiing take according to the man?
[10:05.06]Conversation Two
[10:07.45]W: Good evening and welcome to this week¡¯s ¡°Business World,¡± 
[10:11.10]a program for and about business people. 
[10:14.43]Tonight we have Mr. Angeleno 
[10:16.49]who came to the United States six years ago,
[10:20.05]and is now an established businessman 
[10:22.48]with three restaurants in town. 
[10:25.16]Tell us, Mr. Angeleno, how did you get started?
[10:29.14]M: Well, I started off with a small diner. 
[10:32.91]I did all the cooking myself 
[10:35.31]and my wife waited on tables. 
[10:37.78]It was really too much work for two people. 
[10:41.91]My cooking is great. 
[10:43.84]And word got around town about the food. 
[10:47.10]Within a year,
[10:48.58]I had to hire another cook and four waitresses. 
[10:52.57]When that restaurant became very busy,
[10:55.46]I decided to expand my business. 
[10:58.69]Now with three places,
[11:00.60]my main concern is keeping the business successful 
[11:03.84]and running smoothly.
[11:05.85]W: Do you advertise?
[11:07.49]M: Oh, yes. I don¡¯t have any TV commercials,
[11:11.48]because they are too expensive. 
[11:14.44]But I advertise a lot on radio and in local newspapers. 
[11:19.23]My children used to distribute ads
[11:21.34] in nearby shopping centers,
[11:23.31]but we don¡¯t need to do that any more.
[11:26.05]W: Why do you believe you¡¯ve been so successful?
[11:29.33]M: Um, I always serve the freshest possible food 
[11:33.84]and I make the atmosphere as comfortable 
[11:35.89]and as pleasant as I can,
[11:37.69]so that my customers will want to come back.
[11:41.21]W: So you always aim to please the customers?
[11:44.33]M: Absolutely! Without them,
[11:46.91]I would have no business at all.
[11:49.63]W: Thank you,Mr. Angeleno. 
[11:51.61]I think your advice will be helpful 
[11:53.79]to those just staring out in business.
[11:56.59]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[12:02.93]12. What is the woman¡¯s occupation?
[12:22.48]13. What do we learn about Mr. Angeleno¡¯s business
[12:27.91] at its beginning?
[12:44.20]14. What does Mr. Angeleno say 
[12:48.35]about advertising his business?
[13:06.05]15. What does the man say contributes to 
[13:10.41]the success of his business?
[13:26.39]Section C
[13:27.90]Directions: In this section, 
[13:30.96]you will hear three passages. 
[13:33.64]At the end of each passage, 
[13:35.75]you will hear some questions. 
[13:38.04]Both the passage and the questions
[13:40.20]will be spoken only once. 
[13:43.17]After you hear a question, 
[13:44.95]you must choose the best answer 
[13:47.02]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). 
[13:52.55]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[13:56.43]with a single line through the centre.
[14:00.31]Passage One
[14:02.70]There are many commonly-held beliefs about eye glasses 
[14:06.43]and eyesight that are not proven facts. 
[14:10.11]For instance, some people believe 
[14:12.33]that wearing glasses too soon weakens the eyes. 
[14:17.04]But there is no evidence to show
[14:19.42] that the structure of eyes is changed
[14:21.71] by wearing glasses at a young age. 
[14:24.94]Wearing the wrong glasses,
[14:26.29]however, can prove harmful. 
[14:29.11]Studies show that for adults there is no danger,
[14:32.83]but children can develop loss of vision
[14:35.99] if they have glasses inappropriate for their eyes. 
[14:39.83]We have all heard some of the common myths 
[14:42.33]about how eyesight gets bad. 
[14:45.14]Most people believe that reading in dim light 
[14:48.48]causes poor eyesight,
[14:50.43]but that is untrue. 
[14:52.67]Too little light makes the eyes work harder,
[14:55.99]so they do get tired and strained. 
[14:58.88]Eye strain also results from reading a lot,
[15:02.41]reading in bed,
[15:03.68]and watching too much television. 
[15:06.03]However, although eye strain may 
[15:08.11]cause some pain or headaches,
[15:10.78]it does not permanently damage eyesight. 
[15:14.18]Another myth about eyes is that they can be replaced,
[15:18.18]or transferred from one person to another. 
[15:21.42]There are close to one million nerve fibers
[15:24.43] that connect the eyeball to the brain,
[15:27.27]as of yet it is impossible 
[15:29.52]to attach them all in a new person. 
[15:32.44]Only certain parts of the eye can be replaced. 
[15:35.69]But if we keep clearing up the myths
[15:39.08] and learning more about the eyes,
[15:41.64]some day a full transplant may be possible.
[15:46.36]Questions 16 to 18 are based 
[15:48.52]on the passage you have just heard.
[15:51.80]16. What does the speaker want to tell us about eyesight?
[16:12.84]17. What do studies about wearing the wrong glasses show?
[16:33.44]18. What do we learn about eye transplanting from the talk?
[16:53.48]Passage Two
[16:55.64]When people care for an elderly relative,
[16:58.94]they often do not use available community services 
[17:02.47]such as adult day-care centers. 
[17:05.04]If the caregivers are adult children,
[17:07.81]they are more likely to use such services,
[17:10.83]especially because they often have jobs
[17:13.07] and other responsibilities. 
[17:15.53]In contrast, a spouse,usually the wife,
[17:18.90]is much less likely to use support services
[17:22.09] or to put the dependent person in a nursing home. 
[17:25.59]Social workers discover
[17:27.04] that the wife normally tries to 
[17:28.85]take care of her husband herself
[17:31.28] for as long as she can 
[17:32.90]in order not to use up their life savings. 
[17:36.23]Researchers have found that caring for the elderly
[17:39.13] can be a very positive experience. 
[17:42.36]The elderly appreciated the care 
[17:44.39]and attention they received. 
[17:46.41]They were affectionate and cooperative. 
[17:48.95]However, even when caregiving is satisfying,
[17:52.04]it is hard work. 
[17:54.14]Social workers and experts on aging offer caregivers
[17:57.69] and potential caregivers help 
[17:59.80]when arranging for the care of an elderly relative. 
[18:03.41]One consideration is to ask parents
[18:05.75] what they want before they become sick or dependent. 
[18:09.69]Perhaps they prefer going into a nursing home 
[18:12.42]and can select one in advance. 
[18:15.25]On the other hand,
[18:16.51]they may want to live with their adult children. 
[18:19.98]Caregivers must also learn to state their needs 
[18:22.84]and opinions clearly and ask for help from others,
[18:26.60]especially brothers and sisters. 
[18:29.18]Brothers and sisters are often willing to help,
[18:31.99]but they may not know what to do.
[18:34.39]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[18:40.98]19. Why are adult children more likely 
[18:46.06]to use community services
[18:47.81] to help care for elderly parents?
[19:05.89]20. Why are most wives unwilling to
[19:09.79] put their dependent husbands into nursing homes?
[19:28.85]21. According to the passage,
[19:32.43]what must caregivers learn to do?
[19:50.92]Passage Three
[19:52.50]Since a union representative visited our company
[19:55.91] to inform us about our rights and protections,
[19:59.60]my coworkers have been worrying about health conditions 
[20:03.44]and complaining about safety hazards in the workplace. 
[20:07.45]Several of the employees in the computer department,
[20:10.61]for example,
[20:11.82]claim to be developing vision problems
[20:14.31] from having to stare at a video display terminal
[20:17.10] for about seven hours a day. 
[20:19.89]The supervisor of the laboratory
[20:21.94] is beginning to get headaches and dizzy spells 
[20:25.00]because she says it¡¯s dangerous to
[20:27.70] breathe some of the chemical smoke there. 
[20:30.11]An X-rays technician is refusing to do her job 
[20:33.20]until the firm agrees to replace its out-dated equipment. 
[20:37.42]She insists that it¡¯s exposing workers
[20:40.27] to unnecessarily high doses of radiation. 
[20:43.73]She thinks that she may have to contact
[20:45.99] the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
[20:49.44]and ask that government agency to inspect the department. 
[20:53.80]I¡¯ve heard that at a factory 
[20:55.58]in the area two pregnant women 
[20:58.14]who were working with paint requested a transfer 
[21:01.11]to a safer department,
[21:03.38]because they wanted to prevent damage to their unborn babies. 
[21:08.22]The supervisor of personnel refused the request. 
[21:12.29]In another firm the workers were constantly 
[21:14.97]complaining about the malfunctioning heating system,
[21:18.97]but the owner was too busy 
[21:21.14]or too mean to do anything about it. 
[21:24.25]Finally, they all met and agreed to wear ski-clothing
[21:28.06] to work the next day. 
[21:30.28]The owner was too embarrassed to talk to his employees. 
[21:34.15]But he had the heating system replaced right away.
[21:38.95]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[21:45.09]22. What does the talk focus on?
[22:04.64]23. What did the X-ray technician ask her company to do?
[22:25.38]24. What does the speaker say 
[22:29.22]about the two pregnant women working with paint?
[22:47.53]25. Why did the workers in the firm wear ski-clothing to work?
[23:08.72]This is the end of listening comprehension.
