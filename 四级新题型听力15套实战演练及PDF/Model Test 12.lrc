[00:03.27]Model Test Twelve
[00:05.34]Section A
[00:06.85]Directions: In this section,
[00:10.50]you will hear three news reports. 
[00:13.71]At the end of each news report,
[00:16.61]you will hear two or three questions. 
[00:19.47]Both the news report and the questions 
[00:22.13]will be spoken only once. 
[00:25.44]After you hear a question,
[00:27.46]you must choose the best answer
[00:29.78] from the four choices 
[00:31.45]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[00:34.78]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:38.70] with a single line through the centre.
[00:41.51]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:46.80]The emergency plan announced 
[00:48.82]by the Kenyan Cabinet this week 
[00:51.36]includes mobilizing (¶¯Ô±) the army
[00:53.59] to assist those desperately short on food and water. 
[00:57.57]The plan also nearly doubles the amount of rationed food 
[01:01.60]and provides emergency measures 
[01:03.99]for herders whose livestock
[01:07.02] is threatened by the area¡¯s severe drought. 
[01:10.26]Rockefeller Foundation food security analyst Joseph Nyoro
[01:14.84] welcomed the government¡¯s announcement,
[01:17.55]but said the relief plan was inadequate. 
[01:21.46]Nyoro is also critical of the government¡¯s decision
[01:24.99] to rely on the army 
[01:26.81]as the main vehicle for the assistance,
[01:30.03]saying it is the local communities 
[01:32.51]and the civil society that actually know
[01:35.54] in each area who are suffering the most. 
[01:39.59]The water shortage 
[01:40.78]is also causing a severe energy shortfall 
[01:44.10]across the country,
[01:45.89]which relies heavily on hydro-electric power. 
[01:49.58]Kenya¡¯s major power company
[01:51.63] has instituted systematic power rationing 
[01:54.54]until power supplies improve. 
[01:58.16]1.What¡¯s the main idea of this news report?
[02:18.59]2.Who will the government depend on for the assistance?
[02:38.58]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:44.38]The German former Moto Racing champion 
[02:47.01]Michael Schumacheris having a medical test
[02:50.02] after suffering a head injury 
[02:51.97]while skiing in the French Alps. 
[02:54.93]One of the France¡¯s leading trauma specialists,
[02:57.91]who is also a close friend,
[02:59.92]has flown to the hospital in Grenoble 
[03:02.26]where the former racing driver is being treated. 
[03:06.32]Michael Schumacher
[03:07.56] who is an experienced skier 
[03:09.47]was with his 14-year-old son 
[03:11.50]when he had the accident this morning. 
[03:14.50]His head hit a rock but he was wearing a helmet
[03:17.86] and emergency services were quickly at the scene. 
[03:21.70]He was taken by helicopter
[03:23.46] to hospital at a nearby town of Moutiers. 
[03:27.51]But then later,he was transferred 
[03:29.55]to the larger regional hospital in Grenoble. 
[03:32.95]There is no official word about his condition. 
[03:36.67]3.When did Michael Schumacher get injured?
[03:57.08]4.What do we know about Michael Schumacher?
[04:17.04]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:22.49]More than 100 bodies have been found
[04:24.93] in one village alone in central Nigeria,
[04:28.81]following clashes between Christians and Muslims. 
[04:33.25]And aid workers recovered the corpses 
[04:36.16]in a village 30 kilometers from the city of Jos. 
[04:40.81]From there, our correspondent Caroline Duffield reports. 
[04:46.17]The town of Jos and the area to the south of it 
[04:49.47]are under tight military control. 
[04:52.36]The threat of violence in outlying villages 
[04:55.83]and in the Bukuru area is becoming clearer. 
[04:59.64]Bukuru market, a large commercial area to the south,
[05:03.84]was burnt to the ground. 
[05:06.44]Debris lit the streets and fires are still smoldering. 
[05:11.01]At least 1 000 shops and homes in the market 
[05:14.48]were destroyed in the inferno. 
[05:17.75]5.What can we learn about the clashes in Nigeria?
[05:38.47]6.What do we know about the Bukuru market?
[05:59.03]7.How many shops and homes
[06:02.38] were destroyed in the inferno? 
[06:21.13]Section B
[06:22.84]Directions: In this section, 
[06:25.92]you will hear two long conversations. 
[06:29.33]At the end of each conversation, 
[06:31.53]you will hear four questions. 
[06:34.82]Both the conversation and the questions 
[06:37.05]will be spoken only once. 
[06:40.04]After you hear a question, 
[06:42.04]you must choose the best answer 
[06:44.05]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). 
[06:50.53]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[06:54.37]with a single line through the centre.
[06:57.11]Conversation One
[06:59.07]M: When I say I live in Sweden,
[07:01.51]people always want to know about the seasons.
[07:05.15]W: The seasons?
[07:06.44]M: Yeah, you know,how cold it is in winter,
[07:10.12]what it¡¯s like when the days are so short.
[07:13.00]W: So what is it like?
[07:14.97]M: Well, it is cold,very cold in winter,
[07:18.50]sometimes as cold as 26 degrees centigrade below. 
[07:23.25]And of course,when you go out,
[07:25.49]you wrap up warm. 
[07:26.98]But inside, in the houses,
[07:29.20]it¡¯s always very warm,
[07:31.52]much warmer than at home. 
[07:33.70]Swedish people always complain 
[07:36.00]that when they visit England,
[07:37.85]the houses are cold even in a good winter.
[07:41.71]W: And what about the darkness?
[07:43.85]M: Well, yeah, around Christmas time,
[07:46.82]there¡¯s only one hour of daylight,
[07:49.72]so you really look forward to the spring. 
[07:52.91]It is sometimes a bit depressing. 
[07:55.67]But you see the summers are amazing. 
[07:58.94]From May to July in the north of Sweden,
[08:01.90]the sun never sets. 
[08:04.00]It¡¯s still light at midnight. 
[08:06.14]You can walk in the mountains and read a newspaper.
[08:09.88]W: Oh, yeah, ¡°the land of the midnight sun.¡±
[08:13.17]M: That¡¯s right,but it¡¯s wonderful. 
[08:16.53]You wanna stay up all night,
[08:18.93]and the Swedes make the most of it. 
[08:21.26]Often they start work earlier in summer 
[08:24.12]and then leave at about 2:00 or 3:00 in the afternoon,
[08:28.43]so that they can really enjoy the long summer evenings. 
[08:32.64]They like to work hard,but play hard,too. 
[08:35.81]I think Londoners work longer hours,
[08:38.66]but I¡¯m not sure this is a good thing.
[08:42.03]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[08:47.62]8. What do we learn about the man from the conversation?
[09:07.89]9. What do Swedish people complain about 
[09:12.05]when they visit England in winter?
[09:29.78]10. How does the man describe the short hour of daylight 
[09:34.67]around Christmas in Sweden?
[09:52.05]11. What does the man say about the Swedish people?
[10:12.17] Conversation Two
[10:14.41]W: What kind of training does one need 
[10:16.76]to go into this type of job?
[10:18.90]M: That¡¯s a very good question. 
[10:20.94]I don¡¯t think there is any,specifically.
[10:23.86]W: For example,in your case,
[10:26.65]what was your educational background?
[10:28.73]M: Well, I did a degree in French at Nottingham. 
[10:32.19]After that, I did careers work in secondary schools,
[10:36.00]like the careers guidance people here at the university. 
[10:39.93]Then I went into local government 
[10:42.25]because I found I was more interested in the administrative side,
[10:46.62]then progressed onto universities. 
[10:49.18]So there wasn¡¯t any plan and there was no specific training. 
[10:53.40]There are plenty of training courses in management techniques 
[10:57.15]and committee work which you can attend now.
[11:00.58]W: But in the first place,you did a French degree.
[11:03.26]M: In my time,
[11:04.26]there wasn¡¯t a degree you could do for administration. 
[11:07.20]I think most of the administrators I¡¯ve come across
[11:09.88] have degrees in all sorts of things.
[11:12.75]W: Well, I know in my case,
[11:14.40]I did an English Literature degree 
[11:16.68]and I didn¡¯t really expect to end up doing what I am doing now.
[11:20.47]M: Quite.
[11:21.39]W: Were you local to Nottingham,actually? 
[11:23.61]Is there any reason why you went to Nottingham University?
[11:27.07]M: No, no. I come from the north of England,
[11:30.15]from West Yorkshire. 
[11:31.82]Nottingham was one of the universities I put on my list. 
[11:35.34]And I like the look of it. 
[11:37.14]The campus is just beautiful.
[11:39.01]W: Yes, indeed. Let¡¯s see. 
[11:41.42]Were you from the industrial part of Yorkshire?
[11:44.19]M: Yes, from the wool district.
[11:47.17]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[11:56.58]12. What was the man¡¯s major at university?
[12:17.00]13. What was the man¡¯s job in secondary schools?
[12:38.12]14.Why did the man go into local government?
[12:59.22]15.What attracted the man to Nottingham University? 
[13:19.16]Section C
[13:20.52]Directions: In this section, 
[13:23.89]you will hear three passages. 
[13:26.33]At the end of each passage, 
[13:28.38]you will hear some questions. 
[13:30.78]Both the passage and the questions
[13:33.11]will be spoken only once. 
[13:35.59]After you hear a question, 
[13:37.62]you must choose the best answer 
[13:39.54]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). 
[13:45.30]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[13:49.16]with a single line through the centre.
[13:52.27]Passage One
[13:54.79]While Gail Obcamp,
[13:56.36]an American artist,
[13:57.49]was giving a speech
[13:58.75]on the art of Japanese brush painting 
[14:01.73]to an audience that included visitors from Japan,
[14:05.06]she was confused to see that
[14:06.71] many of her Japanese listeners had their eyes closed. 
[14:11.30]Were they turned off because an American 
[14:13.72]had the nerve to instruct Japanese in their own art form
[14:17.86] or they deliberately tried to signal their rejection of her? 
[14:22.52]Obcamp later found out 
[14:24.13]that her listeners were not being disrespectful. 
[14:27.88]Japanese listeners sometimes close their eyes 
[14:31.35]to enhance concentration. 
[14:33.35]Her listeners were showing their respect for her 
[14:36.14]by chewing on her words. 
[14:38.84]Someday, you may be either a speaker 
[14:41.16]or a listener in a situation involving people
[14:44.35] from other countries 
[14:45.92]or members of a minority group in North America. 
[14:49.36]Learning how different cultures signal respect
[14:52.63] can help you avoid misunderstandings. 
[14:55.80]Here are some examples. 
[14:57.85]In the deaf culture of North America,
[15:00.55]many listeners show applause not by 
[15:03.99]clapping their hands but by waving them in the air. 
[15:07.31]In some cultures,
[15:09.49]both overseas and in some minority groups 
[15:11.84]in North America,
[15:13.30]listeners are considered disrespectful 
[15:15.53]if they look directly at the speaker. 
[15:18.28]Respect is shown by looking in the general direction
[15:21.71] but avoiding direct eye contact. 
[15:24.45]In some countries,
[15:25.90]whistling by listeners is a sign of approval
[15:29.12] while in other countries it is a form of insult.
[15:34.26] Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[15:39.94]16. What did Obcamp¡¯s speech focus on?
[15:59.69]17. Why do Japanese listeners sometimes close their eyes 
[16:05.41]while listening to a speech?
[16:22.49]18. What does the speaker try to explain?
[16:42.27]Passage Two
[16:44.28]Chris is in charge of purchasing 
[16:46.42]and maintaining equipment in his division 
[16:49.32]at Taxalong Company. 
[16:51.94]He is soon going to have an evaluation interview 
[16:54.73]with his supervisor and the personnel director 
[16:57.90]to discuss the work he has done in the past year. 
[17:01.61]Salary, promotion and plans 
[17:03.82]for the coming year will also
[17:05.74] be discussed at the meeting. 
[17:08.30]Chris has made several changes 
[17:10.20]for his division in the past year. 
[17:12.59]First, he bought new equipment for one of the departments. 
[17:16.38]He has been particularly happy about the new equipment 
[17:19.70]because many of the employees 
[17:21.36]have told him how much it has helped them. 
[17:25.16]Along with improving the equipment,
[17:27.24]Chris began a program to train employees
[17:29.84] to use equipment better 
[17:31.74]and do simple maintenance themselves. 
[17:34.94]The training saved time for the employees
[17:37.44] and money for the company. 
[17:39.79]Unfortunately, one serious problem developed during the year. 
[17:44.70]Two employees that Chris hired were stealing,
[17:48.06]and he had to fire them. 
[17:50.38]Chris knows that a new job for a purchasing
[17:52.75] and maintenance manager 
[17:54.06]for the whole company 
[17:55.36]will be open in a few months,
[17:57.30]and he would like to be promoted to the job. 
[18:00.28]Chris knows, however, 
[18:01.43]that someone else wants the new job,too. 
[18:04.36]Kim is in charge of purchasing 
[18:06.94]and maintenance in another division of the company. 
[18:09.68]She has also made several changes over the year. 
[18:13.20]Chris knows that his boss likes Kim¡¯s work,
[18:16.04]and he expects that his work will be compared with hers.
[18:20.09]Questions 19 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[18:26.66]19. What is Chris¡¯s main responsibility at Taxalong Company?
[18:48.93]20. What problem did Chris encounter in his division?
[19:09.92]21. What does Chris hope for in the near future?
[19:30.49]22. What do we learn about Kim from the passage?
[19:51.57]Passage Three
[19:53.55]Proverbs, sometimes called sayings,
[19:56.50]are examples of folk wisdom. 
[19:59.07]They are little lessons which older people of a culture 
[20:02.59]pass down to the younger people to teach them about life. 
[20:07.41]Many proverbs remind people of the values 
[20:10.49]that are important in the culture. 
[20:13.03]Values teach people how to act,
[20:15.69]what is right,and what is wrong. 
[20:18.06]Because the values of each culture are different,
[20:21.71]understanding the values of another culture
[20:24.38] helps explain how people think and act. 
[20:28.97]Understanding your own culture values is important too. 
[20:33.09]If you can accept that people from other cultures act
[20:36.47] according to their values,not yours,
[20:39.56]getting along with them will be much easier. 
[20:42.71]Many proverbs are very old. 
[20:45.29]So some of the values they teach
[20:47.61] may not be as important in the culture
[20:49.89] as they once were. 
[20:51.78]For example,
[20:52.83] Americans today do not pay much attention
[20:56.00] to the proverb ¡°Haste makes waste,¡±
[20:59.22] because patience is not important to them. 
[21:02.56]But if you know about past values,
[21:05.73]it helps you to understand the present
[21:07.78] and many of the older values are still strong today. 
[21:12.32]Benjamin Franklin, a famous American diplomat,
[21:16.02]writer and scientist,died in 1790,
[21:20.53]but his proverb ¡°Time is money¡± 
[21:22.85]is taken more seriously
[21:26.54] by Americans of today than ever before. 
[21:28.30]A study of proverbs from around the world 
[21:31.11]shows that some values are shared by many cultures. 
[21:34.08]In many cases though,
[21:36.82]the same idea is expressed differently.
[21:41.64]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[21:48.07]23. Why are proverbs so important?
[22:07.30]24. According to the speaker,
[22:10.97]what happens to some proverbs with the passage of time?
[22:29.94]25. What do we learn from the study of proverbs 
[22:34.43]from around the world?
[22:51.32]This is the end of listening comprehension.
