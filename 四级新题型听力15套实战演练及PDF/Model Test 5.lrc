[00:02.71]Model Test Five
[00:03.89]Section A
[00:05.16]Directions: In this section,
[00:07.88]you will hear three news reports. 
[00:10.74]At the end of each news report,
[00:13.52]you will hear two or three questions. 
[00:16.55]Both the news report and the questions will be spoken only once. 
[00:22.83]After you hear a question,
[00:24.79]you must choose the best answer from the four choices 
[00:28.82]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[00:32.07]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[00:36.15]with a single line through the centre.
[00:39.59]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:44.43]The Internet search engine company called Google has announced 
[00:49.90]it will give more than twenty-five million dollars 
[00:52.70]in money and investments to help the poor. 
[00:56.50]The money will be spent 
[00:58.38]over the next five to ten years in several areas,
[01:02.00]including poverty reduction and private business development. 
[01:08.93]Aleem Walji works for Google.org¡ª
[01:11.14]the part of the company that gives money to good causes. 
[01:15.61]He spoke to us from San Francisco,California. 
[01:19.48]He said the first project to receive money 
[01:23.38]will help identify where infectious diseases are developing. 
[01:28.33]In Southeast Asia and Africa,for example,
[01:32.07]Google.org will work with partners 
[01:35.54]to strengthen early warning systems 
[01:38.44]and take action against growing health threats. 
[01:42.43]1.How much money will Google spend in helping the poor?
[02:04.46]2.What is the first project of the Google.org Company intended to do?
[02:26.05]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:31.28]Existing home sales climbed for the second month 
[02:34.26]in a row in September,
[02:36.40]fueling some hope that a housing recovery is underway. 
[02:40.35]Sales of previously owned homes rose 10% 
[02:44.91]to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.53 million units last month,
[02:51.48]the National Association of Realtors reported Monday. 
[02:55.47]That was up from a 4.12 million rate in August.
[03:00.07]The report came in much stronger than expected. 
[03:03.90]Economists had forecast sales 
[03:07.03]to edge up to an annual rate of 4.25 million units,
[03:11.47]according to consensus estimates from Briefing.com. 
[03:15.53]The gains of the past two months were welcome news,
[03:19.53]after home sales sank 27% to their lowest level 
[03:24.05]in 15 years in July. 
[03:25.81]While some economists say a housing recovery is underway,
[03:29.77]a foreclosure moratorium in October 
[03:33.44]may have a negative impact on next month¡¯s report.
[03:37.22]3.What can be concluded from existing home sales in August?
[04:00.61]4.What did the economists think about the sales?
[04:21.61]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:27.05]Britain has announced strict measures to curb bankers¡¯ bonuses. 
[04:31.62]There will be a one of fifty percent tax 
[04:34.84]on all payments over 40 000 dollars. 
[04:38.72]The move follows criticism of sizable bonuses banks 
[04:43.81]are planning to pay while receiving government aid. 
[04:49.54]An official of the British banker association Angela Knight said 
[04:54.17]she¡¯s concerned by the decision. 
[04:55.79]¡°When it comes to the broad issues of pay in bonuses,
[04:59.08]we¡¯d already doubted with that. 
[05:01.55]We put it into regulation 
[05:04.08]that contracted bonuses could be differed 
[05:07.46]for two three years paid on consistency of performance only 
[05:13.74]and the majority of that bonus would be paid in shares.¡±She said.
[05:20.27]5.What is mainly talked about in the news item?
[05:40.76]6.Whom will be levied on as for the tax?
[06:00.45]7.What do we know about the bankers¡¯ bonus?
[06:19.76]Section B
[06:21.39]Directions: In this section,
[06:23.97]you will hear two long conversations. 
[06:26.73]At the end of each conversation,
[06:29.39]you will hear four questions. 
[06:31.82]Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once. 
[06:37.52]After you hear a question,
[06:39.72]you must choose the best answer from the four choices 
[06:43.76]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[06:47.00]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[06:51.98]with a single line through the centre.
[06:54.39]Conversation One
[06:56.42]M: English Language Center. 
[06:58.35]May I help you?
[06:59.51]W: Yes. I¡¯m calling to find out more information 
[07:02.97]about your program. For example, 
[07:05.06]what kind of courses do you offer?
[07:07.57]M: Well, first of all,
[07:09.62]the purpose of our program is to provide 
[07:12.73]language learning opportunities to this area¡¯s community,
[07:16.43]whether a student¡¯s goal is 
[07:18.39]to master basic functional language skills,
[07:21.16]let¡¯s say,for his or her job,
[07:22.76]or to study intensively to enter a US college or university.
[07:28.40]W: OK. I¡¯m calling for a friend 
[07:30.97]who is interested in attending a US university.
[07:34.26]M: And that¡¯s the kind of,
[07:35.79]uh, instruction that we provide,
[07:37.92]from basic communication courses to content-based classes 
[07:42.59]such as computer literacy,
[07:44.07]intercultural communication,
[07:45.78]and business English.
[07:47.55]W: Great. What is your application deadline 
[07:50.78]for the next semester?
[07:52.12]M: Well, we ask applicants to apply 
[07:54.64]no later than two months before the semester begins. 
[07:58.33]This gives us time to process the application 
[08:01.54]and issue the students¡¯ I-20.
[08:04.37]W: I-20?
[08:05.41]M: Oh, an I-20 is a form that indicates 
[08:08.82]that we are giving permission for the student 
[08:11.34]to study in our program,
[08:13.05]and then the student takes this form to the US embassy 
[08:16.58]in his or her home country to apply for the F-1 student visa.
[08:21.52]W: Alright. 
[08:22.45]What is the tuition for a full-time student?
[08:25.77]M: It¡¯s ¡ç2 030.
[08:28.60]W: And how can I apply?
[08:30.46]M: Well, we can send you an application 
[08:33.46]and you can mail it back to us,
[08:35.69]or you can fill out our application that¡¯s on our website.
[08:39.51]W: Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation 
[08:43.29]you have just heard.
[08:44.98]8. Which is one of the purposes of the English Language Center?
[09:07.45]9.What can we learn about I-20?  
[09:27.29]10.What do we learn about the program from this conversation? 
[09:47.61]11. If the fall semester begins on August 29,
[09:52.34]by what date should one apply for the program?
[10:11.09]Conversation Two
[10:12.61]M: So, Susan, do you have anything planned for this Saturday?
[10:16.83]W: I¡¯m kind of busy. 
[10:18.89]Why do you ask?
[10:20.37]M: I was wondering 
[10:21.38]if you¡¯d like to get together and do something,
[10:23.61]like watching a movie or taking a walk down by the lake.
[10:27.41]W: I¡¯d love to,
[10:28.80]but I¡¯m really going to be busy all day on Saturday.
[10:32.26]M: What do you have to do on that day?
[10:34.66]W: First, I have to help my mom clean the house in the morning,
[10:38.55]and then I have a dentist appointment at 12:30. 
[10:42.17]I can¡¯t miss that because I¡¯ve canceled twice before.
[10:45.91]M: What about hanging out after that?
[10:48.28]W: Well, I¡¯m going to be running around all day. 
[10:51.49]After the dentist appointment,
[10:53.52]I need to meet Julie at 2:00 
[10:56.12]to help her with her science project 
[10:58.37]that¡¯s due on Monday morning at school.
[11:00.32]M: OK. But are you free after that?
[11:02.77]W: Hardly. 
[11:03.64]Then I have to pick my brother up 
[11:06.42]from soccer practice at 4:30,
[11:08.12]and cook dinner for the family at 5:30. 
[11:11.16]I feel like a slave sometimes.
[11:14.49]M: Wow, sounds like you¡¯re going to have a full day. 
[11:17.55]Why don¡¯t I come over later in the evening,
[11:20.64]and we can make some popcorn and watch a movie.
[11:24.00]W: Oh, that¡¯d be great,
[11:25.64]but our video machine is broken.
[11:28.40]M: Well, let¡¯s just play a game or something.
[11:31.21]W: Sounds good,
[11:32.64]but give me a call before you come. 
[11:35.09]My mom might try to come up with something else for me to do.
[11:39.17]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation 
[11:43.39]you have just heard.
[11:45.88]12. What does Susan have to do on Saturday morning?
[12:06.64]13. What time will Susan meet Julie?
[12:26.63]14. How does Susan feel about her schedule on Saturday?
[12:47.90]15. Why can¡¯t they watch a video at Susan¡¯s house?
[13:08.63]Section C
[13:09.51]Directions: In this section,
[13:12.54]you will hear three passages. 
[13:14.83]At the end of each passage,
[13:16.97]you will hear some questions. 
[13:18.85]Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once. 
[13:23.49]After you hear a question,
[13:25.79]you must choose the best answer from the four choices 
[13:29.73]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[13:32.94]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[13:37.35]with a single line through the centre.
[13:39.88]Passage One
[13:41.68]Charlie Parker is one of America¡¯s greatest jazz musicians. 
[13:47.61]He influenced the direction of jazz music 
[13:50.83]during his short lifetime. 
[13:53.66]He developed a new style of jazz called bebop. 
[13:56.81]Performers of bebop left the traditional musical melody 
[14:01.05]and played a song freely,
[14:03.33]with the music and rhythm being felt at the same time. 
[14:06.79]So, the same song could be played in a different way 
[14:11.06]each time it was performed. 
[14:12.77]Charlie Parker was born in 1920 
[14:16.53]and had his first saxophone in 1933. 
[14:21.09]Charlie developed as a musician 
[14:23.35]by playing with different groups 
[14:25.56]in public eating and drinking places called nightclubs. 
[14:29.13]Meanwhile, Charlie developed serious problems 
[14:32.54]that were to affect the rest of his life. 
[14:34.99]He became dependent on alcohol and the illegal drug,heroin. 
[14:40.35]In 1939, Charlie went to New York City,
[14:43.92]where he began to develop his own style of jazz. 
[14:47.90]Charlie Parker¡¯s name first appeared in the press reports 
[14:51.58]about music in 1940. 
[14:54.00]During the next five years,
[14:55.39]he joined different bands. 
[14:57.56]He apparently did not feel at ease playing with a bit of bands,
[15:01.91]so he returned to New York City in 1947. 
[15:05.67]The following four years are considered his most successful years. 
[15:11.13]He formed his own small bands 
[15:13.83]and played with other groups. 
[15:15.12]He visited Europe three times,
[15:17.80]where he recorded about half of the albums he had ever made. 
[15:22.01]His last public appearance was on March 5,1955, at Birdland. 
[15:28.18]It was not a success. 
[15:29.82]He died seven days later of a heart attack.
[15:33.70]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage 
[15:38.00]you have just heard.
[15:39.51]16. What does the speaker mainly talk about?
[16:00.89]17. What can we learn about Charlie¡¯s music style?
[16:21.95]18. Where did Charlie record about half of his albums?
[16:42.23]Passage Two
[16:43.63]Crime is a serious problem in Britain. 
[16:46.75]One sort of crime which particularly worries people 
[16:49.80]is juvenile delinquency¡ªthat is,
[16:52.99]crimes committed by young people. 
[16:55.67]For some years,
[16:56.91]juvenile delinquency has been increasing. 
[16:59.50]There are two main sorts of juvenile crime: 
[17:03.29]stealing and violence. 
[17:05.54]Most people do not understand 
[17:07.70]why young people commit these crimes. 
[17:10.56]There are, I think,
[17:12.33]a large number of different reasons. 
[17:15.04]These crimes are not usually committed by people 
[17:19.21]who are poor or in need. 
[17:21.52]Young people often dislike and resent the adult world. 
[17:25.33]They will do things to show that they are rebels. 
[17:28.47]Also in Britain today,
[17:30.75]it is easier for young people to commit crimes 
[17:34.05]because they have more freedom to go where 
[17:36.63]they like and more money to do what they like. 
[17:39.89]There are two other possible causes 
[17:42.06]which are worth mentioning. 
[17:43.64]More and more people in Britain live in large towns. 
[17:47.51]In a large town,
[17:49.22]no one knows who anyone else is or where he lives. 
[17:53.93]But in the village I come from crimes are rare 
[17:57.94]because everybody knows each other. 
[18:00.13]Although it is difficult to explain,
[18:02.69]I think the last cause is very important. 
[18:05.39]Perhaps there is something wrong with our society 
[18:09.27]which encourages violence and crime. 
[18:11.41]It is a fact that all the time 
[18:14.18]children are exposed to films and reports 
[18:17.02]about crime and violence. 
[18:19.05]Many people do not agree that this influences young people,
[18:23.38]but I think that young people are very much influenced 
[18:27.54]by the society they grow up in. 
[18:29.86]I feel that the fault may be as much with our whole society 
[18:34.04]as with these young people.
[18:36.46]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage 
[18:40.87]you have just heard.
[18:43.06]19. What is ¡°juvenile delinquency¡±?
[19:04.42]20. Which are considered to be the causes of juvenile delinquency?
[19:24.83]21. Who are to blame for juvenile delinquency 
[19:28.40]according to the speaker?
[19:46.05]Passage Three
[19:47.44]Many animals recognize their food because they see it. 
[19:52.02]So do humans. 
[19:53.35]When you see an apple or a piece of chocolate,
[19:56.55]you know that these are things you can eat. 
[19:59.73]You can also use other senses when you choose your food. 
[20:03.87]You may dislike some types of food because they do not look,
[20:08.97]smell or taste very nice. 
[20:11.30]Different animals use different senses 
[20:14.21]to find and choose their food. 
[20:16.86]A few animals depend on only one of their senses,
[20:20.84]while most animals use more than one sense. 
[20:25.07]Although there are many different types of food,
[20:27.84]some animals spend their lives eating only one type. 
[20:31.61]The panda eats only one particular type of bamboo. 
[20:36.80]Other animals eat only one type of food even 
[20:40.21]when given the choice. 
[20:42.19]A kind of white butterfly will stay on the leaves of a cabbage,
[20:46.41]even though there are plenty of other vegetables in the garden. 
[20:51.20]However, most animals have a more varied diet. 
[20:55.41]The bear eats fruits,
[20:57.17]honey and fish. 
[20:58.50]The fox eats small animals,
[21:00.67]birds and fruits. 
[21:02.44]The diet of these animals will be different depending on the season. 
[21:07.43]Humans have a very varied diet. 
[21:10.97]We often eat food because we like it 
[21:13.99]and not because it is good for us. 
[21:16.50]In countries such as France and Britain,
[21:19.86]people eat foods with too much sugar. 
[21:22.35]This makes them overweight,
[21:24.73]which is bad for their health. 
[21:26.74]Eating too much red meat and animal products,
[21:29.99]such as butter,
[21:31.22]can also be bad for the health. 
[21:33.83]Choosing the right food,
[21:35.31]therefore, has become an area of study in modern life.
[21:39.09]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage 
[21:43.96]you have just heard.
[21:45.92]22. How do most animals choose food? 
[22:07.48]23. Which of the following animals eats only one type of food?
[22:27.96]24. When do some certain animals change their choice of food?
[22:49.03]25. What can we know about people in France and Britain?
[23:10.10]This is the end of listening comprehension.
