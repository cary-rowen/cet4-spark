[00:02.43]Model Test Four
[00:03.75]Section A
[00:05.17]Directions: In this section,
[00:08.59]you will hear three news reports. 
[00:11.77]At the end of each news report,
[00:14.43]you will hear two or three questions. 
[00:17.23]Both the news report and the questions will be spoken only once. 
[00:23.92]After you hear a question,
[00:25.75]you must choose the best answer from the four choices 
[00:29.59]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[00:32.55]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[00:36.78]with a single line through the centre.
[00:39.88]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:44.86]The World Health Organization is urging countries 
[00:50.57]to follow six policies to prevent millions of deaths 
[00:54.89]linked to tobacco use. 
[00:56.87]The six policies are known as MPOWER,
[01:01.24]spelled M-P-O-W-E-R. 
[01:05.50]The letter M means monitoring tobacco use 
[01:08.28]and prevention policies. 
[01:10.38]The P is for protecting people by establishing smoke-free areas. 
[01:16.74]O is for offering services to help people stop smoking. 
[01:22.63]The letter W means warning people about the dangers of tobacco. 
[01:28.30]E is for enforcing bans on tobacco advertising 
[01:32.35]and other forms of marketing. 
[01:34.67]And R is for raising taxes on tobacco. 
[01:38.61]A World Health Organization report says 
[01:42.86]raising taxes is the single most effective way 
[01:46.83]to reduce tobacco use. 
[01:49.35]A study found that governments now collect 
[01:52.07]an average of five hundred times more money 
[01:55.55]in tobacco taxes each year than they spend on control efforts. 
[02:01.08]The report says tobacco now causes 
[02:03.62]more than five million deaths a year. 
[02:06.99]It predicts this number will rise to 
[02:10.94]more than eight million by the year 2030. 
[02:15.17]By the end of the century,
[02:17.74]it says,
[02:18.89]tobacco could kill one billion people¡ª
[02:22.03]ten times as many as in the twentieth century. 
[02:27.79]1.What is the most effective way to reduce tobacco use?
[02:50.82]2.How many people die from tobacco each year?
[03:12.38]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[03:16.15]Guitar legend and recording industry pioneer  Les Paul 
[03:20.06]died on Thursday,August 13,
[03:22.87]at a hospital in White Plains,New York,
[03:26.25]of complications from pneumonia. 
[03:28.70]He was 94 years old. 
[03:31.49]Known for his virtuosity on guitar,
[03:35.20]Paul made breakthrough discoveries 
[03:37.81]that forever changed the sound of popular music. 
[03:40.67]Les Paul single-handedly changed the course of music 
[03:45.41]when he developed his solid body guitar,
[03:48.11]and discovered a new way to record voices and instruments. 
[03:52.60]Paul became known as the ¡°Wizard of Waukesha,¡± 
[03:56.91]by people in his Wisconsin home town. 
[03:59.73]Born Lester William Polfuss,
[04:03.41]he was self-taught on guitar,
[04:05.66]and loved to experiment with electronic equipment. 
[04:08.40]He performed country music at a local restaurant 
[04:12.20]when he was 10 years old,
[04:13.61]and by age 13,
[04:15.64]had built his own broadcasting station and recording device. 
[04:20.01]He played and traveled with country bands 
[04:23.32]and even hosted his own radio show in Chicago.
[04:27.18]3.What is this news item mainly about? 
[04:49.44]4.When did Les Paul build his own broadcasting station?
[05:11.09]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[05:17.49]Another bomb has gone off in southern Thailand,
[05:20.94]the fourth in 24 hours. 
[05:23.59]The latest blast that is reported 
[05:26.68]to have injured four soldiers was in Yala province. 
[05:31.03]Even while senior government officials 
[05:33.60]held an emergency meeting to discuss three bombs overnight,
[05:38.71]the fourth was detonated. 
[05:40.57]The blast in Yala on Monday 
[05:43.35]marks a return to form for violence 
[05:46.05]in the southernmost provinces,
[05:48.18]where soldiers, police and local officials 
[05:51.27]have been targeted by almost daily shootings and small explosions. 
[05:56.63]But the attacks overnight 
[05:59.17]represent a different kind of threat 
[06:02.35]to Thailand¡¯s national security. 
[06:04.68]The three explosions on Sunday 
[06:07.80]killed two people and injured as many as 60. 
[06:12.51]All of the blasts are thought to have been trigged 
[06:15.98]by mobile phone signals in the first major attacks 
[06:19.85]outside the southernmost provinces 
[06:22.82]in the large cities of Hat Yai and Songkhla.
[06:26.92]5.What were the senior government officials doing 
[06:32.97]when the last bomb went off?
[06:50.92]6. Who were targeted by daily shootings and small explosions 
[06:56.31]in the southernmost provinces?
[07:13.82]7. What were the blasts triggered by?
[07:33.38]Section B
[07:34.62]Directions: In this section,
[07:37.46]you will hear two long conversations. 
[07:40.42]At the end of each conversation,
[07:42.79]you will hear four questions. 
[07:45.24]Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once. 
[07:51.10]After you hear a question,
[07:53.04]you must choose the best answer from the four choices 
[07:57.21]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[08:00.46]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[08:05.69]with a single line through the centre.
[08:08.54]Conversation One
[08:10.17]W: Hi, Jim, I have something urgent to talk over with you. 
[08:15.20]Could you spare a few minutes right now?
[08:17.66]M: Sure, come in and take a seat,please. 
[08:20.31]What¡¯s on your mind?
[08:22.62]W: I was just talking to the library supervisor. 
[08:25.71]He said the main frame was repaired yesterday. 
[08:29.06]That helps a lot,
[08:30.79]but there are some other problems with our students.
[08:33.77]M: Again? 
[08:35.03]What¡¯s the problem this time?
[08:36.60]W: He said the students were supposed 
[08:39.01]to reserve the terminal computers for only one hour a day 
[08:43.87]because so many students need to use them every day.
[08:46.62]M: We¡¯ve already made it as a regulation 
[08:49.69]to reserve the terminals within the hour given,
[08:52.41]haven¡¯t we?
[08:53.26]W: Yes, we have. 
[08:54.53]But quite a number of our students are required 
[08:57.39]to accomplish such assignments as designs 
[09:00.56]and researches towards the end of the semester.
[09:03.41]M: I can see that. 
[09:04.90]But does it bring about any problems?
[09:07.16]W: Well, now it frequently occurs 
[09:09.56]that some of our students aren¡¯t willing to give up terminals 
[09:12.92]when their hour is over.
[09:14.84]M: I suppose they feel that since they are almost done,
[09:18.57]a few more minutes won¡¯t matter.
[09:20.27]W: Yes, most likely. 
[09:21.81]But this renders it inconvenient for people 
[09:25.53]who are waiting for their turn to use the machine.
[09:27.73]M: You¡¯re right. 
[09:28.80]Let¡¯s draft the memo right now. 
[09:31.27]We can pass it out in our classes tomorrow 
[09:34.08]to clear up the problem. 
[09:35.79]To make it known to all will be crucial to the solution.
[09:39.25]W: I agree. 
[09:40.53]And now I consider it a necessity to tighten the control 
[09:44.63]over the time limits.
[09:46.17]M: OK. 
[09:47.58]Let¡¯s get started right away.
[09:49.58]W: Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation 
[09:53.11]you have just heard.
[09:54.81]8. Who are the speakers?
[10:14.29]9. How long is each student allowed 
[10:17.97]to use the terminal computers?
[10:35.24]10. What is one of the problems in the library?
[10:55.33]11. What are the speakers going to do next to solve the problem?
[11:16.51]Conversation Two
[11:18.12]M: Take a seat,please. 
[11:19.10]What do you do at the moment? 
[11:20.89]W: I¡¯m a personal assistant to the manager of a modeling agency. 
[11:25.32]M: You work with people a lot,do you? 
[11:27.93]W: Oh, yes. 
[11:29.47]I have to look after all the models who work for us,
[11:32.38]you know,keep them happy,
[11:34.76]lend an understanding ear to their regrets.
[11:37.43]M: Have you ever done anything 
[11:39.44]with hotels or conferences¡ªhotel management,
[11:42.80]for instance? 
[11:43.73]W: No, not really. 
[11:47.50]I did work for a short time for a tour operator,
[11:49.78]taking foreigners on guided tours of London. 
[11:52.50]Perhaps that¡¯s the sort of thing you mean. 
[11:55.04]M: Yes, I think it is. 
[11:56.62]And what about any exams you¡¯ve taken? 
[11:59.52]W: Well, I left school at 16. 
[12:02.20]M: So you have no formal qualifications at all? 
[12:06.18]Well, I don¡¯t suppose it matters. 
[12:08.36]W: I was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about the job. 
[12:12.50]M: Well, we run conferences,
[12:14.97]and your job as a conference coordinator would be much the same 
[12:19.87]as the one you are doing now,
[12:21.44]I suppose¡ªmeeting people,
[12:22.78]transporting them from one place to another,
[12:25.65]making sure they¡¯re comfortable,
[12:27.38]a bit of telephoning,and so on.
[12:29.84]W: It sounds like just the sort of thing 
[12:32.84]I want to do.
[12:33.85]M: Perhaps you¡¯d care to have a quick look 
[12:35.95]round the office here,
[12:37.23]see if you like the people who work here.
[12:39.35]W: That¡¯s very nice of you. 
[12:41.17]Thank you.
[12:42.20]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation 
[12:46.46]you have just heard.
[12:48.48]12. What does the woman do for her present job?
[13:09.93]13.When did the woman leave school?
[13:29.67]14. What kind of job is the woman applying for?
[13:50.36]15. What will the woman do next according to the conversation?
[14:11.92]Section C
[14:12.79]Directions: In this section,
[14:15.84]you will hear three passages. 
[14:17.98]At the end of each passage,
[14:21.30]you will hear some questions. 
[14:22.89]Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once. 
[14:27.42]After you hear a question,
[14:29.54]you must choose the best answer from the four choices 
[14:33.36]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[14:36.41]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[14:41.24]with a single line through the centre.
[14:43.93]Passage One
[14:45.30]The average family spends about one sixth of its income on food. 
[14:50.94]Because food is expensive,
[14:53.22]it is important to spend money wisely when you shop. 
[14:57.63]A careful shopper can prepare nutritious 
[15:01.07]and delicious meals inexpensively. 
[15:03.94]Here are some hints to help you shop better. 
[15:07.25]Buy only the food that you need. 
[15:10.38]There are several ways to avoid buying extra food. 
[15:14.45]First, make a shopping list before you go to the store. 
[15:19.27]Then, when you are at the store,
[15:20.86]follow your list carefully. 
[15:23.69]Furthermore, do not go shopping if you are hungry. 
[15:28.10]When you are hungry,
[15:32.01]food looks very delicious and you want to buy more than you need. 
[15:35.32]Finally, go shopping alone if you can. 
[15:39.51]If you shop with young children,
[15:41.88]they often ask you to buy them unnecessary food like candy. 
[15:46.26]When you have a selection,
[15:48.34]choose the least expensive brand of a product. 
[15:51.66]There are three points to remember 
[15:54.24]when you buy a can of tomatoes,for example. 
[15:57.57]First, look at the advertisements in the newspaper to see 
[16:02.46]if your supermarket is having a ¡°special¡± on canned tomatoes. 
[16:06.43]In addition, when you are in the store,
[16:09.46]you should check the price per pound of tomatoes. 
[16:12.79]Sometimes you save money if you buy the larger-sized can; 
[16:17.85]sometimes,however, you don¡¯t. 
[16:20.15]Third, remember that a grade A product 
[16:23.41]or a more expensive product is not necessarily 
[16:26.40]more healthy than a grade B or less expensive product. 
[16:30.74]Grade A tomatoes may look better,
[16:33.78]but all canned tomatoes have the same nutrients.
[16:37.62]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[16:43.61]16. What does the speaker mainly talk about?
[17:06.92]17. What is the suggestion to help shop better?
[17:27.15]18. Why does the speaker advise 
[17:29.95]to read the advertisements in the newspaper before shopping?
[17:49.11]Passage Two
[17:49.94]If parents bring up a child 
[17:51.53]with the aim of turning him into a genius,
[17:54.03]they will cause a disaster. 
[17:56.34]According to several leading educational psychologists,
[18:00.81]this is one of the biggest mistakes 
[18:03.15]that ambitious parents make. 
[18:05.42]Generally, the child will be only too aware of 
[18:08.93]what the parent expects,and will fail. 
[18:12.30]Unrealistic parental expectations can 
[18:15.89]cause great damage to children. 
[18:18.04]However, if parents are not too unrealistic 
[18:21.31]about what they expect their children to do,
[18:24.20]but are ambitious in a sensible way,
[18:27.95]the child may succeed in doing very well¡ª
[18:30.95]especially if the parents are very supportive of their child. 
[18:34.59]Michael Li is very lucky. 
[18:37.34]He is crazy about music,
[18:40.12]and his parents help him a lot by taking him to concerts 
[18:44.81]and arranging private piano and violin lessons for him. 
[18:48.62]Although Michael¡¯s mother knows very little about music,
[18:52.52]Michael¡¯s father plays the trumpet in a large orchestra. 
[18:56.50]However, he never makes Michael enter music competitions 
[19:00.42]if he is unwilling to do so. 
[19:02.61]Michael¡¯s friend, Winston Chen,
[19:05.39]however, is not so lucky. 
[19:07.70]Although both his parents are successful musicians,
[19:11.38]they set too high a standard for him. 
[19:14.46]They want him to be as successful as they are,
[19:17.66]so they enter him in every piano competition held. 
[19:22.03]They are very unhappy when he doesn¡¯t win. 
[19:25.14]¡°When I was your age,
[19:26.94]I used to win every competition I entered.¡± 
[19:30.73]Winston¡¯s father tells him. 
[19:32.91]Winston is always afraid 
[19:35.23]that he will disappoint his parents 
[19:37.35]and now he always seems quiet and unhappy.
[19:41.80]Questions19 to 21 are based on the passage 
[19:46.64]you have just heard.
[19:48.47]19. What is the right attitude in bringing up a child?
[20:11.24]20. What can we learn about Winston Chen¡¯s parents?
[20:31.75]21. Why does Winston Chen always seem quiet and unhappy?
[20:53.12]Passage Three
[20:54.46]As any homemaker who has tried to keep order 
[20:57.91]at the dinner table knows,
[20:59.25]there is far more to a family meal than food. 
[21:03.21]Sociologist Michael Lewis has been studying 50 families 
[21:08.51]to find out just how much more. 
[21:10.82]Lewis and his co-workers carried out their study 
[21:14.90]by videotaping the families 
[21:17.14]while they ate ordinary meals in their own homes. 
[21:20.76]They found that parents with small families 
[21:25.43]talked actively with each other and their children. 
[21:27.30]But as the number of children got larger,
[21:30.25]conversation gave way to the parents¡¯ efforts 
[21:33.44]to control the loud noise they made. 
[21:36.29]That can have an important effect on the children. 
[21:39.56]¡°In general, the more question-asking the parents do,
[21:43.89]the higher the children¡¯s IQ scores are,¡± Lewis says,
[21:47.74]¡°and the more children there are,
[21:50.07]the less question-asking there is.¡± 
[21:52.60]The study also provides an explanation 
[21:54.73]for why middle children often seem to 
[21:57.86]have a harder time in life than their brothers and sisters. 
[22:01.62]Lewis finds that in families with three or four children,
[22:05.51]dinner conversation is likely to center on the oldest child,
[22:09.70]who has the most to talk about,
[22:11.70]and the youngest,
[22:12.78]who needs the most attention. 
[22:14.62]¡°Middle children are invisible,¡± says Lewis. 
[22:18.30]¡°When you see someone get up from the table 
[22:21.73]and walk around during dinner,
[22:23.30]it¡¯s often the case that it¡¯s the middle child.¡±
[22:26.15] There is,however, one thing 
[22:28.66]that stops all conversation and prevents anyone 
[22:32.18]from having attention. 
[22:33.52]¡°When the TV is on,¡± Lewis says,
[22:37.21]¡°dinner is a non-event.¡±
[22:38.98]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage 
[22:44.90]you have just heard.
[22:46.63]22. What is the purpose of the passage?
[23:06.66]23. Why do parents with larger families 
[23:11.04]ask fewer questions at dinner?
[23:29.39]24. Which statement would the speaker probably agree with?
[23:49.97]25. What will prevent all conversation at dinner?
[24:10.91]This is the end of listening comprehension.
