[00:02.39]Model Test Eleven
[00:04.45]Section A
[00:06.23]Directions: In this section,
[00:09.84]you will hear three news reports. 
[00:13.12]At the end of each news report,
[00:15.49]you will hear two or three questions. 
[00:18.88]Both the news report and the questions 
[00:21.67]will be spoken only once. 
[00:24.81]After you hear a question,
[00:27.94]you must choose the best answer
[00:29.35] from the four choices 
[00:30.74]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[00:33.63]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:37.85] with a single line through the centre.
[00:41.00]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:47.33]Eighty thousand gold miners have begun a strike in South Africa. 
[00:52.57]As the strike began the national union of mine workers said
[00:57.55] it would accept a 10% raise 
[01:00.23]instead of their original demand of 60%. 
[01:04.09]The General Secretary of
[01:05.80] the National Union of Mineworkers,
[01:08.21]Frans Baleni told the BBC that 
[01:11.04]if the gold companies offered a 10% wage increase,
[01:15.34]this would be accepted 
[01:17.20]and the strike would be called off. 
[01:20.54]Despite this development,
[01:22.60]the main gold mining union 
[01:24.86]has also issued a hard-hitting statement,
[01:28.22]saying the strike 
[01:29.54]would change the gold mining landscape forever. 
[01:33.81]It said it was aware of
[01:36.10] the devastating impact industrial action 
[01:39.04]would have on the economy,
[01:41.37]calling it largely a white man¡¯s economy 
[01:44.77]with no benefits for poor black mine workers.
[01:50.36]1.How many gold miners took part in the strike in South Africa?
[02:12.16]2.What should the gold companies do to call off the strike?
[02:33.41]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:39.25]Italians have been trying for months
[02:41.57] to guess the SuperEnalotto¡¯s winning six number combination. 
[02:46.91]No one has managed,since January. 
[02:49.87]This has driven the winning prize
[02:52.01] to an all-time high for Europe. 
[02:55.03]Chances of guessing the correct combination 
[02:57.97]are an astronomical 622-million-to-one. 
[03:03.41]Fausto Rossi is a former bank employee who is now retired. 
[03:08.49]He plays lotto every week. 
[03:11.54]He says he dreams that he will win. 
[03:14.38]And, the dreams continue when you ask players 
[03:17.52]what they would do
[03:18.59] if they won such a huge amount of money. 
[03:22.10]Rossi says that some people
[03:23.86] are prone to lose their minds 
[03:26.01]if they find out they have won such an enormous jackpot.
[03:30.43]Tourists in Italy have also been playing the SuperEnalotto. 
[03:34.61]And, foreigners have been coming across
[03:37.28] the border (±ß¾³) to try their luck,as well. 
[03:40.07]They have been arriving from Slovenia,
[03:42.16]France and Austria. 
[03:45.35]In Germany, a major tabloid newspaper
[03:48.36] has sponsored a competition,
[03:50.61]awarding a chance to win free flights 
[03:53.77]to Italy simply to buy tickets for the lotto drawings.
[03:58.91]3.What does this news report mainly talk about?
[04:19.60]4.What¡¯s the award provided
[04:22.70] by the German tabloid newspaper?
[04:40.78]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:47.14]A key committee of Euro MPs 
[04:49.92]has moved to block the renewal of an agreement
[04:53.12] which allows US anti-terror officials 
[04:56.00]to access Europeans bank data. 
[04:59.36]The European Parliament¡¯s civil liberties committee
[05:02.62] recommended that the full parliament 
[05:05.14]reject the interim nine-month deal between the EU and US. 
[05:10.95]MEPs said the deal negotiated by EU governments 
[05:15.11]provided insufficient privacy safeguards. 
[05:20.52]The US can access the Swift Money Transfer System,
[05:22.73]based in Brussels. 
[05:24.64]The European Parliament plans to vote on the EU 
[05:28.02]and US data agreement next Thursday. 
[05:31.96]The Parliament¡¯s press service says that if MEPs block it,
[05:36.63]they will be making use of a new power
[05:39.57] under the Lisbon Treaty to veto international agreements.
[05:44.99]5.What is the decision of the Euro MPs?
[06:05.25]6.Why was the deal rejected?
[06:24.55]7.What will the MEPs use to veto international agreements? 
[06:48.02]Section B
[06:49.65]Directions: In this section, 
[06:52.65]you will hear two long conversations. 
[06:55.93]At the end of each conversation, 
[06:58.42]you will hear four questions. 
[07:01.51]Both the conversation and the questions 
[07:03.86]will be spoken only once. 
[07:06.92]After you hear a question, 
[07:08.85]you must choose the best answer 
[07:10.88]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). 
[07:17.29]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[07:21.11]with a single line through the centre.
[07:23.72]Conversation One
[07:25.63]W: Good evening,
[07:26.31]and welcome to this week¡¯s ¡°Business World,¡±
[07:29.47]the program for and about business people. 
[07:32.95]Tonight, we have Mr. Steven Kayne, 
[07:35.67]who has just taken over an established bicycle shop. 
[07:39.85]Tell us, Mr. Kayne, 
[07:41.35]what made you want to run your own store?
[07:44.04]M: Well, I¡¯ve always loved racing bikes and fixing them. 
[07:48.87]When I was working full-time 
[07:50.70]as a salesman for a big company,
[07:53.34]I seldom had time to enjoy my hobby. 
[07:56.82]I knew then that as soon as I had enough money 
[08:00.24]to get my own business going,I¡¯d do it. 
[08:03.71]I had my heart set on it 
[08:05.97]and I didn¡¯t let anything stand in my way. 
[08:09.49]When I went down to the bank and got a business loan,
[08:13.35]I knew I¡¯d love being my own boss. 
[08:16.36]Now my time is my own. 
[08:18.41]I open the store when I want and leave when I want.
[08:22.73]W: You mean you don¡¯t keep regular hours?
[08:25.72]M: Well, the sign on my store says 
[08:28.18]the hours are ten to six,
[08:30.50]but if business is slower than usual,
[08:33.19]I can just lock up and take off early.
[08:36.32]W: Have you hired any employees to work with you yet?
[08:39.81]M: Yeah, a couple of friends of mine
[08:42.14] who love biking as much as I do. 
[08:45.17]They help me out a few days a week. 
[08:47.70]It¡¯s great because we play cards
[08:49.68] or just sit around and talk when there are no customers.
[08:52.98]W: Thank you,Mr. Kayne.
[08:54.36] We wish you success in your new business.
[08:58.31]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[09:04.19]8. What is the woman doing?
[09:22.67]9. What did Mr. Kayne do 
[09:25.69]before he took over the bicycle shop?
[09:43.44]10. Why did the man take over a bicycle shop?
[10:03.07]11. What do we learn about the people working in the shop?
[10:23.47]Conversation Two
[10:25.57]W: Well, the main activities in the region 
[10:28.10]were historically steel and paper processing,I think.
[10:31.61]M: Yes, but I¡¯m not quite sure about 
[10:34.42]the status of those industries now. 
[10:37.45]Could you tell us something about that?
[10:39.50]W: Yes, of course. In fact, they are less significant,
[10:43.49]but steel-related manufacturing still 
[10:45.79]accounts for 44% of industrial activity. 
[10:50.03]So it¡¯s still very important. 
[10:52.33]In fact, 80% of Spain¡¯s machine tools
[10:55.60] are from the Basque Country. 
[10:57.83]As for paper processing,there¡¯s still a little. 
[11:01.21]But it¡¯s no longer what it once was in the region. 
[11:04.33]So, is that clear?
[11:06.00]M: Yes, thanks.
[11:07.58]W: Now, to get back to what I was saying,
[11:10.25]there¡¯s a lot of unemployment as well as 
[11:12.77]geographical problems in the region.
[11:14.89]M: Sorry, Victoria. 
[11:16.42]What do you mean by geographical problems?
[11:19.38]W: Well, what I mean is the area is very hilly,
[11:23.26]mountainous in parts,
[11:25.03]so there used to be transport problems. 
[11:27.92]Now though there are new train links and better roads. 
[11:31.73]But it may be that some smaller towns inland
[11:34.90] remain not very well connected. Is that OK? 
[11:38.79]Does that make sense? 
[11:40.43]When we talk about specific location suggestions
[11:42.69] for the factory,
[11:44.46]we¡¯ll see this in more detail,
[11:46.59]so we¡¯ll come back to this question,OK?
[11:49.24]M: OK, right.
[11:50.79]W: So I was about to say something about 
[11:53.14]the work force in the region 
[11:54.74]and the level of training and education. 
[11:57.39]In general, it¡¯s very good and improving.
[12:01.32]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[12:07.93]12. What does the woman say 
[12:11.15]about steel-related manufacturing in the region?
[12:30.19]13.What can we learn about paper processing in the region? 
[12:51.19]14.What problem hinders the region¡¯s development?
[13:11.36]15.What will the speakers discuss later?
[13:30.83] Section C
[13:32.46]Directions: In this section, 
[13:35.21]you will hear three passages. 
[13:37.92]At the end of each passage, 
[13:39.90]you will hear some questions. 
[13:42.22]Both the passage and the questions
[13:44.36]will be spoken only once. 
[13:47.48]After you hear a question, 
[13:49.52]you must choose the best answer 
[13:51.09]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). 
[13:56.74]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[14:00.68]with a single line through the centre.
[14:04.05]Passage One
[14:05.96]I first met Joe Ganz when we were both nine years old,
[14:10.44]which is probably the only reason
[14:12.39] he¡¯s one of my best friends. 
[14:15.00]If I had first met Joe as a freshman in high school,
[14:18.75]we wouldn¡¯t even have had the chance 
[14:20.65]to get to know each other. 
[14:22.81]Joe is a day student,
[14:24.90]but I am a boarding student. 
[14:27.12]We haven¡¯t been in the same classes,
[14:29.49]sports or extracurricular activities. 
[14:32.59]Nonetheless, I spend nearly every weekend
[14:35.90] at his house and we talk on the phone every night. 
[14:39.98]This is not to say that we would not have been compatible
[14:43.06] if we had first met in our freshman year. 
[14:45.94]Rather, we would not have been likely
[14:48.19] to spend enough time getting to know each other 
[14:51.48]due to the lack of immediately visible mutual interests. 
[14:54.23]In fact, to be honest,
[14:57.26]I struggle even now to think of things we have in common,
[15:01.88]but maybe that¡¯s what makes us
[15:04.09] enjoy each other¡¯s company so much. 
[15:06.45]When I look at my friendship with Joe,
[15:08.95]I wonder how many people I¡¯ve known whom I never disliked,
[15:13.48]but simply didn¡¯t take the time to get to know. 
[15:16.46]Thanks to Joe,
[15:17.79]I have realized how little basis there is 
[15:20.43]for the social divisions that exist in every community. 
[15:24.63]Since this realization,
[15:26.81]I have begun to make an even more determined effort
[15:30.18] to find friends in unexpected people and places.
[15:35.33] Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[15:40.43]16. Why does the speaker say 
[15:44.05]Joe Ganz became one of his best friends?
[16:02.33]17. Where does the speaker spend most of his weekends?
[16:22.84]18. What has the speaker learned 
[16:26.15]from his friendship with Joe?
[16:44.00]Passage Two
[16:46.05]It was a bad night for Lewis. 
[16:48.71]His research in the neighboring town 
[16:50.85]had taken longer than he expected. 
[16:53.87]It was late and he was very tired when he drove home. 
[16:57.19]He turned into his building¡¯s parking lot,
[16:59.91]but all the spaces were full. 
[17:02.05]He drove back out onto the street,
[17:04.19]looking for a parking space. 
[17:06.48]The first block was full. 
[17:08.50]The next block was almost empty. 
[17:11.12]Lewis didn¡¯t see a ¡°No Parking¡± sign,
[17:14.34]but he suspected that if parking were allowed there,
[17:17.58]most of the spaces would be filled. 
[17:19.96]Then he saw a small parking lot with two free spaces. 
[17:24.11]He was so glad to see them that
[17:25.90] he didn¡¯t even think to read the sign by the entrance. 
[17:30.88]He drove in,parked and hurried home to go to bed. 
[17:33.39]The next morning he went back to the lot to get his car. 
[17:36.82]It was gone. 
[17:38.04]He ran home and telephoned the city police
[17:40.85] to say that his car had been stolen. 
[17:43.67]It took the police only a minute to tell him 
[17:45.84]what had happened: 
[17:47.14]His car had been on a private lot. 
[17:49.87]It had been taken away by the police. 
[17:53.11]Lewis had to take a taxi to the city garage 
[17:55.58]far from the center of town. 
[17:58.46]He had to pay a fee of ¡ç40 to get his car back. 
[18:02.17]In addition, he got a parking ticket,
[18:05.26]his first one ever in Greenville.
[18:08.47]Questions19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[18:15.71]19. Where did Lewis intend to park his car 
[18:20.25]when he came back from work one night?
[18:38.05]20. What did Lewis think had happened 
[18:41.83]to his car the next morning?
[18:59.77]21. Where did Lewis finally get his car back?
[19:21.06]Passage Three
[19:22.54]Well, to pick up where we left off last time,
[19:26.82]I believe we agreed that creativity is a mysterious idea. 
[19:32.01]It¡¯s one of those things we all recognize when we see it. 
[19:36.19]But we don¡¯t really understand what it is. 
[19:39.61]We seem to feel that some people are naturally creative,
[19:43.88]but we don¡¯t know how they got that way. 
[19:46.91]Is creativity a natural gift like good looks? 
[19:51.21]Or is it something that can be acquired like knowledge? 
[19:55.50]Perhaps if we analyze the creative process carefully,
[19:59.59]we might get some insight into what it is 
[20:02.77]and how it might work in our lives. 
[20:05.62]The creative process has always been accepted 
[20:08.83]as the source of all important work in the arts. 
[20:12.89]But we should not think the creativity
[20:15.38] plays a role only in the arts. 
[20:18.12]Every major scientific discovery began with someone
[20:21.90] imagining the world to look differently 
[20:24.37]from the way others saw it. 
[20:26.55]And this is what the creativity is all about
[20:29.64]¡ªimagining the world in a new way. 
[20:32.44]And despite what you may believe
[20:34.30] about the limits of your own creative imaginations,
[20:38.60]we all have the potential to imagine the world 
[20:41.58]in an absolutely new way. 
[20:44.34]In fact, you were born with it. 
[20:46.93]It is your birth right as a human being. 
[20:49.87]And what¡¯s more,
[20:51.02]you use it every day almost every moment of your life. 
[20:56.08]Your creative imagination is
[20:58.48] what you use to make sense of your experiences. 
[21:02.45]It¡¯s your creative mind that gets meaning 
[21:05.55]from the chaos of your experiences 
[21:08.10]and brings order to your world.
[21:11.74]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[21:18.39]22. What did the speaker most probably discuss last time?
[21:39.45]23. What is a widely accepted idea about the creative process?
[22:01.69]24. What leads to major scientific discoveries 
[22:06.99]according to the speaker?
[22:24.69]25. What does the speaker imply about the creative process?
[22:45.84]This is the end of listening comprehension.
