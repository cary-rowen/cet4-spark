[00:00.78]Model Test 15
[00:03.55]Section A
[00:05.47]Directions: In this section,
[00:08.78]you will hear three news reports. 
[00:12.20]At the end of each news report,
[00:14.68]you will hear two or three questions. 
[00:17.91]Both the news report and the questions 
[00:20.68]will be spoken only once. 
[00:23.60]After you hear a question,
[00:25.96]you must choose the best answer from the four choices 
[00:29.76]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[00:33.05]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[00:37.17]with a single line through the centre.
[00:40.55]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:46.64]Kenyan police say one person was killed and 26 injured 
[00:51.30]in an explosion at a bus station in central Nairobi. 
[00:56.05]The blast hit a bus about to set off for the Ugandan capital Kampala. 
[01:02.50]Last July, the Somali group al-Shabab said 
[01:06.09]it was behind the blasts in the Ugandan capital 
[01:09.18]which killed more than 70 people. 
[01:12.26]Will Ross reports from the Kenyan capital.
[01:16.23]The explosion happened beside a bus 
[01:18.89]which was about to set off for an overnight journey 
[01:22.60]from Nairobi to the Ugandan capital Kampala. 
[01:26.62]Some eyewitnesses report that a bag 
[01:29.23]was about to be loaded on board,
[01:32.08]but it exploded during a security check. 
[01:35.80]Windows of the red bus were left smashed,
[01:39.26]and blood could be seen on the ground beside the vehicle. 
[01:43.43]Just hours earlier,
[01:45.21]Uganda¡¯s police chief had warned of possible 
[01:48.74]Christmas-time attacks by Somali rebels.
[01:53.69]1. What is the news report mainly about?
[02:14.21]2. When did the incident occur?
[02:33.36]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:39.37]Woolworths is one of the best known names 
[02:42.03]on the British High Street. 
[02:44.33]It¡¯s been in business nearly a century.
[02:47.43]Many of its 800 stores are likely to close 
[02:51.35]following the company¡¯s decision 
[02:53.16]to call in administrators after an attempt
[02:56.51] to sell the business for a token ¡ê1 failed.
[03:01.27]The company has huge debts. 
[03:04.27]The immediate cause for the collapse 
[03:06.24]has been Britain¡¯s slide toward recession,
[03:09.45]which has cut into consumer spending. 
[03:12.18]However, the business had been in trouble for years.
[03:16.91]Known for low-priced general goods,
[03:19.78]Woolworths has struggled in the face of competition 
[03:22.91]from supermarkets expanding beyond groceries 
[03:26.20]and a new generation of internet retailers. 
[03:30.03]Many of the store group¡¯s 25 000 employees 
[03:33.92]are likely to lose their jobs. 
[03:36.76]Some profitable areas such as 
[03:39.21]the DVD publishing business will survive.
[03:43.93]3. What do we learn about Woolworths from the news report?
[04:05.32]4. What did Woolworths attempt to do recently?
[04:26.13]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:31.92]Cairo is known for its overcrowded roads,
[04:36.25]irregular driving practices and shaky old vehicles,
[04:40.85]but also for its air pollution. 
[04:43.71]In recent months, though, environmental studies 
[04:47.21]indicate there have been signs of improvement. 
[04:51.16]That¡¯s due in part to the removal of many 
[04:54.11]of the capital¡¯s old-fashioned black and white taxis. 
[04:58.49]Most of these dated back to the 1960s and 70s 
[05:03.54]and were in a poor state of repair.
[05:06.54]After new legislation demanded 
[05:09.40]their removal from the roads,
[05:11.94]a low interest loan scheme was set up 
[05:15.11]with three Egyptian banks so drivers could buy new cars. 
[05:20.31]The government pays about $900 for old ones 
[05:24.76]to be discarded and advertising on the new vehicles 
[05:29.02]helps cover repayments.
[05:31.73]The idea has proved popular with customers
[05:35.72]¡ªthey can now travel in air-conditioned comfort 
[05:39.43]and because the new cabs are metered,
[05:42.62]they don¡¯t have to argue over fares. 
[05:45.71]Banks and car manufacturers are glad 
[05:49.03]for the extra business in tough economic times. 
[05:52.80]As for the taxi drivers,
[05:55.13]most are delighted to be behind the wheel of new cars,
[05:59.96]although there have been a few complaints 
[06:03.57]about switching from black and white to a plain white colour.
[06:08.87]5. What change took place in Cairo recently?
[06:29.66]6. What helped bring about the change?
[06:49.75]7. Why do customers no longer argue with new cab drivers?

[07:12.12]Section B
[07:13.83]Directions: In this section, 
[07:16.87]you will hear two long conversations. 
[07:20.15]At the end of each conversation, 
[07:22.33]you will hear four questions. 
[07:24.92]Both the conversation and the questions 
[07:27.92]will be spoken only once. 
[07:31.09]After you hear a question, 
[07:32.74]you must choose the best answer 
[07:34.87]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). 
[07:40.51]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[07:44.92]with a single line through the centre.

[07:47.99]Conversation One
[07:50.80]W: What sort of hours do you work, Steve?
[07:53.60]M: Well, I have to work very long hours,
[07:57.25]about 11 hours a day.
[07:59.64]W: What time do you start?
[08:01.53]M: I work 9:00 to 3:00. 
[08:04.32]Then I start again at 5:30 and work until 11:00,
[08:09.18]six days a week. 
[08:10.78]So I have to work very unsocial hours.
[08:14.40]W: And do you have to work at the weekend?
[08:17.14]M: Oh, yes, that¡¯s our busiest time. 
[08:20.14]I get Wednesdays off.
[08:22.00]W: What are the things you have to do 
[08:23.99]and the things you don¡¯t have to do?
[08:25.86]M: Uh, I don¡¯t have to do the washing-up,
[08:29.06]so that¡¯s good. 
[08:30.24]I have to wear white,
[08:31.82]and I have to keep everything in the kitchen totally clean.
[08:36.45]W: What¡¯s hard about the job?
[08:38.40]M: You are standing up all the time. 
[08:40.74]When we are busy,
[08:42.27]people get angry and sharp,
[08:44.82]but that¡¯s normal.
[08:46.08]W: How did you learn the profession?
[08:48.10]M: Well, I did a two-year course at college. 
[08:51.37]In the first year,
[08:52.71]we had to learn the basics,
[08:54.43]and then we had to take exams.
[08:56.94]W: Was it easy to find a job?
[08:59.18]M: I wrote to about six hotels and 
[09:01.97]one of them gave me my first job,
[09:03.95]so I didn¡¯t have to wait too long.
[09:06.06]W: And what¡¯s the secret of being good at your job?
[09:09.05]M: Attention to detail. 
[09:11.22]You have to love it. 
[09:12.68]You have to show passion for it.
[09:14.64]W: And what are your plans for the future?
[09:17.01]M: I want to have my own place when the time is right.
[09:21.54]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation 
[09:24.69]you have just heard.
[09:26.87]8. What does the man say about his job?
[09:46.13]9. What does the man think is the hardest part of his job?
[10:06.64]10. Where did the man get his first job after graduation?
[10:26.18]11. What does the man say is important to being good at his job?
[10:47.14]Conversation Two
[10:49.83]W: Now you¡¯ve seen this table of figures 
[10:52.64]about the pocket money children in Britain get?
[10:55.37]M: Yes. I thought it was quite interesting,
[10:58.99]but I don¡¯t quite understand the column entitled ¡°Change.¡± 
[11:04.07]Can you explain what it means?
[11:06.10]W: Well, I think it means the change from the year before. 
[11:10.33]I¡¯m not a mathematician,
[11:12.15]but I assume the rise from 72p to 90p is a rise of 25%.
[11:18.81]M: Oh, yes, I see. 
[11:21.31]And the inflation rate is there for comparison.
[11:24.41]W: Yes. Why do you think the rise in pocket money 
[11:27.51]is often higher than inflation?
[11:30.06]M: I am sorry I¡¯ve no idea. 
[11:32.67]Perhaps parents in Britain are too generous.
[11:35.82]W: Perhaps they are. 
[11:37.19]But it looks as if children were a lot better off 
[11:39.93]in 2001 than they were in 2002. 
[11:43.97]That¡¯s strange, isn¡¯t it? 
[11:45.67]And they seem to have been better off in 2003 than they are now. 
[11:50.48]I wonder why that is.
[11:52.26]M: Yes, I don¡¯t understand that at all.
[11:55.48]W: Anyway, if you had children,
[11:57.48]how much pocket money would you give them?
[11:60.00]M: I don¡¯t know. 
[12:01.45]I think I¡¯ll probably give them ¡ê2 a week.
[12:05.06]W: Would you? 
[12:06.05]And what would you expect them to do with it?
[12:08.15]M: Well, out of that,
[12:10.14]they have to buy some small personal things,
[12:13.03]but I wouldn¡¯t expect them to save to buy their own socks,
[12:17.66]for example.
[12:18.18]W: Yes, by the way,
[12:20.10]do most children in your country get pocket money?
[12:22.80]M: Yeah, they do.
[12:24.96]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation 
[12:28.30]you have just heard.
[12:31.08]12. What is the table of figures about?
[12:51.06]13. What does the column entitled ¡°Change¡± mean 
[12:55.51]according to the woman?
[13:13.01]14. What do we learn from the conversation about 
[13:17.83]British children¡¯s pocket money?
[13:35.01]15. Supposing the man had children,
[13:39.43]what would he expect them to do with their pocket money?
[13:57.89]Section C
[13:58.94]Directions: In this section, 
[14:02.21]you will hear three passages. 
[14:04.45]At the end of each passage, 
[14:06.62]you will hear some questions. 
[14:09.08]Both the passage and the questions
[14:11.33]will be spoken only once. 
[14:13.71]After you hear a question, 
[14:15.81]you must choose the best answer 
[14:17.96]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). 
[14:22.96]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[14:27.27]with a single line through the centre.

[14:31.31]Passage One
[14:33.11]As the new sales director for a national computer firm,
[14:37.37]Alex Gordon was looking forward to his first meeting 
[14:41.00]with the company¡¯s district managers. 
[14:43.73]Everyone arrived on time,
[14:45.83]and Alex¡¯s presentation went extremely well. 
[14:49.84]He decided to end the meeting with the conversation 
[14:53.02]about the importance of the district managers 
[14:55.86]to the company¡¯s plans. 
[14:58.15]¡°I believe we are going to continue to increase 
[15:00.62]our share of the market, ¡± he began,
[15:03.70]¡°because of the quality of the people in this room. 
[15:06.83]The district manager is the key to the success 
[15:09.63]of the sales representatives in his district. 
[15:13.07]He sets the term for everyone else. 
[15:15.28]If he has ambitious goals and is willing to put in long hours,
[15:19.61]everyone in his unit will follow his example.¡± 
[15:23.33]When Alex was finished,
[15:25.17]he received polite applause,
[15:27.73]but hardly the warm response he had hoped for. 
[15:30.86]Later£¬ he spoke with one of the senior managers. 
[15:34.57]¡°Things were going so well until the end£¬¡± 
[15:37.62]Alex said disappointedly£¬
[15:39.76] ¡°Obviously, I said the wrong thing.¡± 
[15:42.30]¡°Yes£¬¡± the district manager replied£¬
[15:45.55] ¡°half of our managers are women. 
[15:47.92]Most have worked their way up 
[15:49.81]from sales representatives,
[15:51.66]and they are very proud of the role 
[15:53.38]they played in the company¡¯s growth. 
[15:55.74]They don¡¯t care at all about political correctness. 
[15:59.46]But they were definitely surprised 
[16:01.88]and distressed to be referred to as ¡®he¡¯ in your speech.¡±
[16:06.56]Questions 16 to 19 are based on the passage 
[16:10.98]you have just heard.
[16:13.78]16. Who did Alex Gordon speak to at the first meeting?
[16:34.16]17. What did Alex want to emphasize
[16:37.97] at the end of his presentation?
[16:55.68]18. What do we learn about the audience at the meeting?
[17:15.30]19. Why did Alex fail to receive the warm response 
[17:20.21]he had hoped for?
[17:36.17]Passage Two
[17:38.01]The way to complain is to act businesslike and important. 
[17:42.54]If your complaint is immediate,
[17:44.91]suppose you got the wrong order at a restaurant,
[17:47.71]make a polite but firm request to see the manager. 
[17:51.55]When the manager comes,
[17:53.03]ask his or her name. 
[17:55.18]And then state your problem and 
[17:57.33]what you expect to have done about it. 
[18:00.05]Be polite! Shouting or acting rude will get you nowhere. 
[18:04.60]But also be firm in making your complaint. 
[18:07.92]Besides, act important. 
[18:10.62]This doesn¡¯t mean to put on airs and say ¡°do you know who I am?¡± 
[18:15.41]What it means is that people are often treated 
[18:17.84]the way they expect to be treated. 
[18:20.44]If you act like someone who expects a fair request to be granted,
[18:24.32]chances are it will be granted. 
[18:27.40]The worst way to complain is over the telephone. 
[18:30.25]You are speaking to a voice coming from someone you cannot see. 
[18:34.34]So you can¡¯t tell how the person on the line is reacting. 
[18:38.96]It is easy for that person to give you the runaround. 
[18:42.15]Complaining in person or by letter is generally more effective. 
[18:47.64]If your complaint does not require an immediate response,
[18:51.14]it often helps to complain by letter. 
[18:54.30]If you have an appliance that doesn¡¯t work,
[18:56.65]send a letter to the store that sold it. 
[18:59.70]Be businesslike and stick to the point. 
[19:02.59]Don¡¯t spend a paragraph on how your Uncle Joe tried 
[19:05.63]to fix the problem and couldn¡¯t.
[19:08.22]Questions 20 to 22 are based on the passage 
[19:11.94]you have just heard.
[19:14.63]20. What does the speaker suggest you do 
[19:19.16]when you are not served properly at a restaurant?
[19:37.42]21. Why does the speaker say the worst way 
[19:41.83]to complain is over the telephone?
[19:59.83]22. What should you do if you make a complaint by letter?
[20:20.50]Passage Three
[20:22.54]Barbara Sanders is a wife and the mother of two children,
[20:27.09]ages two and four. 
[20:28.96]Her husband, Tom, is an engineer and makes an excellent salary. 
[20:34.47]Before Barbara had children,
[20:36.97]she worked as an architect for the government,
[20:39.78]designing government housing. 
[20:41.80]She quit her job when she became pregnant,
[20:44.80]but is now interested in returning to work. 
[20:48.71]She¡¯s been offered an excellent job with the government. 
[20:53.07]Her husband feels it¡¯s unnecessary for her to work
[20:57.53]since the family does not need the added income. 
[21:01.57]He also thinks that a woman should stay home with her children. 
[21:06.29]If Barbara feels the need to do socially important work,
[21:10.32]he thinks that she should do volunteer work one or two days a week. 
[21:15.68]Barbara, on the other hand,
[21:18.05]has missed the excitement of her profession 
[21:21.21]and does not feel she would be satisfied doing volunteer work. 
[21:25.64]She would also like to have her own income,
[21:28.93]so she does not have to ask her husband for money 
[21:32.05]whenever she wants to buy something. 
[21:34.48]She does not think it¡¯s necessary to stay home every day 
[21:38.19]with the children and she knows a very reliable baby-sitter 
[21:42.52]who¡¯s willing to come to her house. 
[21:45.43]Tom does not think a baby-sitter can replace a mother 
[21:49.64]and thinks it¡¯s a bad idea for the children 
[21:52.64]to spend so much time with someone who¡¯s not part of the family.
[21:58.41]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage 
[22:02.28]you have just heard.
[22:04.91]23. What was Barbara¡¯s profession before she had children?
[22:26.20]24. What does Barbara¡¯s husband suggest she do 
[22:30.20]if she wants to work?
[22:46.85]25. What does Tom think about hiring a baby-sitter?
[23:07.47]This is the end of listening comprehension.
